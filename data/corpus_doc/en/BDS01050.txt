kanmuryojukyosho(commentaries on meditation sutra)
"kanmuryojukyosho" is a commentary written by shandao of china.
the book totally renewed the commentaries of "kanmuryo jukyo" written by joto-sect scholars.
in japan,the book was of special interest to honen,who made it a basis for his religious doctrines.
it is abbreviated as "kangyosho."
because it consists of four volumes(shijo),it is also called "kangyo shijosho" and abbreviated as "shijosho."
the commentary did not circulate widly in china.
however,in japan,it was highly regarded by honen,who was the founder of the jodo(pure land)sect,and was supported because 'he relied solely on shandao.'
and shinran,who is believed to be the founder of jodo shinshu(the true pure land sect of buddhism),praised the book by stating that 'zendodokumyobutsushoi(shandao was the only one who clarified the message of buddha)' in "shoshin nembutsuge".
as seen above,the book greatly influenced the formation of pure land buddhism in japan.
