fujiwara no kinnari
fujiwara no kinnari(999-august 1,1043)was a court noble in the heian period.
he was part of the kanin lineage of the northern house of the fujiwara clan.
he was the eldest son of chunagon(vice-councilor of state)fujiwara no sanenari.
his mother was fujiwara no chinsei's daughter.
he held the rank of junii(junior second rank),and the titles of sangi(royal advisor)and gon chunagon(provisional vice-councilor of state).
he also used a self-given alternate name of betto shigenoi.
among his children were fujiwara no sanesue,fujiwara no shigeko,and yorishinobu.
his childhood name was inugimi.
he was adopted by his grandfather,daijo-daijin(grand minister of state)fujiwara no kinsue,at an early age,and was excessively loved by him.
kinsue is said to have always had kinnari accompany him,even to his official events,and entreated crown prince atsunaga(later emperor gosuzaku)for his favor on his behalf so passionately that the prince found it rather laughable.
he was appointed as a chamberlain in 1011,as a ushosho(minor captain of the right division of inner palace guards)in 1013,as a uchujo(middle captain of the right division of inner palace guards)in 1017,as a kurodo no to(head chamberlain)in 1021,as a sachujo(middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards)in 1023,and as a sangi in 1026.
although the highest rank kinnari held was junii gon chunagon,his daughter shigeko,who was adopted by dainagon(chief councilor of state)fujiwara no yoshinobu,became emperor go-sanjo's wife and emperor shirakawa's mother triggered the great prosperity of the kanin lineage in later years,and his family line came to turn out many ministers.
for a period of time he was in love with koshikibu no naishi,and had a daughter yorishinobu with her.
