history
initially,yoshisato sugawara,who was six generations after sugawara no michizane,built a sacred place in the wakae district,kawachi province,under imperial command in 1018.
the name of the shrine comes from a legend that says the tenichi jin(god worshipped in onmyodo((way of yin and yang)),taishaku ten,descended from the sky with a streak of light,when michizane was degraded.
during the mongol invasion,when emperor gouda ordered the shrine to pray to fight off the izoku(barbarians),all of the ships of yuan sank,and the emperor presented a plaque to the shrine that says "tenka muteki hisshori un."
the shrine lost its land in the onin rebellion,and was transferred to the premises of to-ji temple.
in the edo period,the wakae family,the family of shinto priests serving the shrine on a hereditary basis was revived,the main building of the shrine was rebuilt in tonodan,and was enshrined in its current location in 1761.
ieyasu tokugawa deeply revered the shrine,prayed for halcyon times of peace in 1570,and made efforts to revive the wakae family.
in 1636,after the death of ieyasu,iemitsu tokugawa moved the statue of ieyasu from the sento-gosho imperial palace to this shrine to be the enshrined deity.
the current main building of the shrine was transferred and reconstructed in 1872 after dismantling the old chinju-sha shrine(the shinto shrine on buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area)of the konoe family.
