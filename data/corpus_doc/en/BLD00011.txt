branch management
the bank has branches and local offices in cities and villages of kyoto prefecture,as well as in shiga prefecture,osaka prefecture,nara prefecture,hyogo prefecture and metropolitan tokyo.
during the prewar era,most bank offices in kyoto city were branches of major city banks,as was the case in tokyo city(now boroughs),but there were only a few regional banks.
unfortunately,every one of them took the path of merger into major banks,and during the war the regional banks in kyoto city became defunct;eventually the last of them,kyoto ouchi bank,was split and transferred to the fuji bank,limited(now mizuho bank,limited)and kyoto bank,whose head office was located in fukuchiyama city at that time.
for this reason,after the war there was a call to create regional banks with the local capital,and tanwa bank(with its head office in fukuchiyama city),which had originally been an integrated bank during the war in regions of tanba province and tango province,entered business in kyoto city.
in 1953,the bank moved its head office to the current location(formerly the site of the old takashimaya company,limited),and increased its number of branches in kyoto city through acquisition of those of other banks,including city banks or opening up them independently.
however,in the 1980s it abolished most of its branches outside kyoto prefecture.
the bank has yet to be officially designated by the kyoto city administration because it's a newcomer relatively speaking and its bank-deposit share(among financial institutions with more than a trillion yen in deposits)in kyoto city is comparable to those of kyoto chuo shinkin bank,the kyoto shinkin bank,the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj,ltd.and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation.
(it accounts for less than a trillion yen in deposits in kyoto city,but there are other bank branches,such as mizuho bank and shiga bank in kyoto city,as well as many branches of the nanto bank,ltd.in the southern part of kyoto prefecture.)
in recent years,aiming to acquire new source of revenue,the bank has again started aggressively opening new branches outside kyoto prefecture.
since 2000 it has invested heavily,opening new branches in areas along the railway lines between kyoto and osaka in osaka prefecture in addition to neighboring shiga and nara prefectures,and it is actively competing with shiga bank and nanto bank as well as major city banks.
it opened the amagasaki branch(december,2004),kobe branch(september,2005),kawanishi branch(october,2007)and rokkomich branch(november,2005)in hyogo prefecture,encouraged by the absence of other competitive regional banks in the prefecture after the bankruptcy of the now-defunct hyogo bank(accelerating the increase of bank businesses from other prefectures,including kyoto bank).
it also operates an online branch called "the bank of kyoto,ltd.net direct."
the bank operates atms carrying the name "the bank of kyoto,ltd.station atm" at main stations jointly with keihan electric railway co.,ltd.
