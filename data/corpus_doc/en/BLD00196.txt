shuden-zukuri style
shuden-zukuri style is the term proposed in architectural history for indicating the architectural style of samurai residences during the muromachi period.
initially,samurai residences followed the shinden-zukuri style,and the layout of the shogun yoshinori ashikaga's residence(hana no gosho(literally,flower palace))is centered on a shinden(main house).
however,by the time of yoshimasa ashikaga's higashiyama-dono,a tsune no gosho(a building for living)called the shuden was created.
the shuden was a place where all daily activities could be done with a room for conducting taimen(meeting to confirm the relations between lord and retainer)and buddhist services and bedroom.
this architectural style is different from that of the shinden-zukuri style,where a shinden and tainoya(the building where family members of the residence lived)were connected with a corridor,and the shoin-zukuri style where an entrance,a dai-shoin(a large drawing room)and a sho-shoin(a small drawing room)were connected in a row.
it is considered as a distinct architectural style and called the shuden-zukuri style.

no buildings of the shuden-zukuri style have survived from that time and its characteristics can only be surmised from existing related documents.
although built more recently,it is said that the shoin(drawing room)at onjo-ji temple maintains some aspects of the shuden-zukuri style.
the floor,shelves and shoin give an impression of an old-fashioned shoin.
the reception hall of kangakuin(built in 1600)and reception hall of kojoin(built in 1601)at onjo-ji temple are national treasures.
the shoin that was once in nikko-in of onjo-ji temple was dismantled and reconstructed in tokyoto become the gekko-den(literally,a moon light hall)at gokoku-ji temple(important cultural property).
