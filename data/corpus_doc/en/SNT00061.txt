the current imamiya-jinja shrine is said to have originated in may 1001 when the temple was built in the current location and the three gods were enshrined after goryo-e(ritual ceremony to repose of spirits of a deceased person)was performed in mt.funaoka in 994,but the year of establishment at the current location is unknown,although it has long been a shrine enshrining susanoo(currently,sessha(auxiliary shrine-dedicated to a deity close-related to that of a main shrine)eki-jinja shrine),the god of epidemics.
goryo-e is also called imamiya-sai festival,and was prohibited for a while from the end of heian period to the beginning of kamakura period.
