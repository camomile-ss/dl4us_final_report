akishino
akishino is the name of place in nara city,nara prefecture,and according to the present residence indication,it is akishino-cho.
it belonged once to sonoshimo county,yamato province and corresponds to the region which expands in the north of saidai-ji temple(nara city)which,in turn,existed in the northwestern end of heijokyo(ancient capital of japan in present nara).
it is a land which is the origin of miyago(reigning name)of akishinonomiya,a member of present imperial family.
it is said that akishino was a place noted in connection with the haji clan since older times and,when kabane(hereditary title)of yasuhito haji was changed from sukune(third highest of the eight hereditary titles)to ason(second highest of the eight hereditary titles)in 782,he changed his name to yasuhito akishino 'in connection with the name of the place of residence.'
a little while before that(there are different views about the exact period),akishino-dera temple was established in the south of akishino.
it has been established that,in 931,there existed akishinosho,a shoen(manor)owned under the name of jingan-ji temple(former name of jingo-ji temple).
it has been established that,later in 1158,the ownership had been transferred to gokoku-ji temple,which was a bettoji(a temple attached to a shrine)of iwashimizu-hachimangu shrine.
it is also known as utamakura(a place famed in classical japanese poetry)for waka and saigyo's waka recorded in the "shinkokin wakashu" (new collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry), 'it must be raining in akishino and villages in mountains,because mt.ikoma is covered with cloud' and jien's waka recorded in the "shugyoku-shu" (collection of gathered jewels), 'in the course of my trip,it is sad in autumn hearing voice of japanese deers and insects of akishino in the night' are known as representative ones.
