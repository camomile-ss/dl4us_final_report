abe no miko
abe no miko(648-year of death unknown)was a prince of the emperor tenchi.
his mother was iga no uneme yakako no iratsume.
his name does not appear in "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan).
he is described in 'iganokuni meisho no ki' (a record of noted places in iga province)as a younger brother-uterine of the emperor kobun,but the authenticity is uncertain.
due to this uncertainty,there is even a theory says that he was a fictitious character.
in addition,there is another theory that he was not a prince but a princess,and that he and the princess ahe,who later become the empress genmei,were the same person.
