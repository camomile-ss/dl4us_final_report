normal school
a shihan gakko(normal school)is an middle and advanced educational institution for training teachers for elementary/middle schools(shihan education)under the prewar educational system reform.
summary
based on the educational school system published in 1872,a normal school was established by the government in yushima seido temple,succeeding part of shoheizaka-gakumonjo closed in 1871,and then they were established in each school system district such as osaka,sendai,nagoya,hiroshima,nagasaki,and niigata.
by 1878 all government-established normal schools excluding tokyo normal school and tokyo women's normal school were transferred to their prefectures.
besides these schools,there were many other normal schools,established independently by each prefecture,for training elementary school teachers,but there was no uniformity in the period of education and entrance age.
in 1881 guidelines of rules for teaching for normal schools were set up under education order,which led to the first unification of the level of normal schools.
with the enactment of normal school order in 1886,the normal schools were divided into higher normal schools and ordinary normal schools.
in 1897 with the enactment of normal school order,the ordinary normal school was renamed to normal school.
in 1907 with the start of a six-year elementary school system,normal school regulations were set up and the second normal schools for middle-school graduates were institutionalized.
in 1943 due to the revision of normal school order all the normal schools were transferred to the government and also promoted to educational institutions equal to old-system vocational schools,and youth normal schools were set up afresh(the order was revised the next year).
(as for normal schools in taiwan,among japanese old oversea territories,refer to the normal school institutions in taiwan during the japanese colonial period.)
on condition of becoming teachers after graduation,normal school students are exempted from paying tuition and also ensured their livelihood,they played a role of helping excellent children from poor families.
if a student could manage to take the course as follows:normal school＝>higher normal school＝>university of literature and science,the student could complete a course which was equivalent to a regular route:middle school＝>high school＝>imperial university,with no school expenses,thus normal schools attracted many students who were excellent but suffering financial burdens.
people who received benefit from this system were as follows;yoshifuru akiyama,a military serviceman in the meiji and the taisho periods,chung-hee park,a military serviceman and president of the republic of korea in the showa period,(both of them entered army war college(japan)after a teaching career),keita goto,a businessman(the first leader of the tokyu group;he graduated from ueda senior high school in nagano prefecture,worked as an elementary school assistant teacher,entered tokyo higher normal school,working as an english teacher,and went on to the university of tokyo),etc.(kan kikuchi,a writer,was forced to enter tokyo higher normal school for an economic reason,but expelled because of his bad behavior and reentered daiichi senior high school with financial support from a rich person).
however,after the war,for the democratization of japan,the supreme commander for the allied powers of general headquarters(ghq/scap)dismantled the normal school system,which had been a hotbed of the militaristic education,and gave an instruction that teacher training should be done at universities on the u.s.model.
people began to criticize normal schools;the dormitory life of the normal school was quite the same as that of a naimu-han(internal affairs corps)of the imperial japanese army with seniors always teasing and hazing juniors to teach them absolute obedience to their seniors,and the education content also had a lot of problems such as teaching what was described in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters)as an authentic history,and the graduates,as supporters of the militarist education,kept sending their students to the front.
such education resulted in producing a lot of so-called 'normal school type teachers' who were rigid,narrow-minded,and stereotyped,emphasizing formalism,authoritarianism,blind obedience,etc.,which had already been a problem in prewar days,too.
therefore,normal schools in various regions,on the model of american universities such as "liberal arts colleges",made a fresh start as department of education or department of liberal arts of new-system universities that embodied various old-system schools.
however,in the screening accompanied by the transition from an old-system normal school to a university,a lot of teachers failed in the screening and lost their jobs because the screening naturally focused on teachers' achievements as scholars/researchers,but those who failed knew nothing more than practical knowledge such as how to use blackboards or managing their classes.
therefore,at this time,many schools replaced teachers extensively,and the campuses of normal/youth and normal schools in a prefecture are integrated in series,as a result school traditions changed greatly.
on the model of "liberal arts colleges" the curriculum at first put emphasis on liberal arts education with some universities providing a course to a medical school,however,following the upgrading of elementary/middle schools after world war ii,most of the graduates chose a teaching job,and when the revised national school establishment law came into force in 1966,most of departments of arts and sciences sequentially abolished courses not related to school teaching and began to change their names to "department of education".
the current system allows students in every department to get a teacher's license.
as a result,however,some people pointed out that this system produced incompetent teachers who had not majored in pedagogy,and some proposed that the normal school system be revived.
however,professional education at graduate schools is a global trend and even in japan with the introduction of a professional graduate school system for highly professional education including legal profession,it was decided that the acquisition of advanced skills needed by future teachers should be done at a graduate level.
therefore,teaching profession graduate school system as one of professional graduate schools was introduced and established on april 1,2008.
1886-1943
higher normal schools/women's higher normal schools
the higher normal school was a school that trained middle school teachers.
the schools were as follows;
higher normal school(1886-),from 1902 tokyo higher normal school.
women's higher normal school(1900-),from 1908 tokyo women's higher normal school
hiroshima higher normal school(1902-)
nara women's higher normal school(1908-)
normal school order in 1897 decided that higher normal schools train teachers for normal,ordinary middle and women's higher schools,and women's higher normal schools train teachers for women's/women's higher schools.
higher normal schools accepted middle school graduates,and women's higher normal schools accepted women's higher school graduates.
as a principle bachelor's titles were given only to university graduates,however graduates from tokyo higher normal school advanced course and hiroshima higher normal school advanced course of moral education were allowed to receive bachelor's titles as exceptional cases(matters about titles of graduates from higher normal schools[imperial decree no.36 in 1930]).
ordinary normal schools(normal schools)
the ordinary normal school is a school that trains elementary school teachers.
in each prefecture one normal school with the men' section and the women's section was set up.
in accordance with normal school order in 1897,ordinary normal schools were renamed normal schools,and one or more normal schools were established in each prefecture.
the women's section was separated as a women's normal school by the latter half of the 1920s.
the first regular course(a five-year system from 1925)which required graduation from an higher elementary school(elementary school higher course)for entrance,the second regular course which required graduation from a middle school or a women's higher school(institutionalized in 1907,a two-year system from 1931)were set up.
1943-1949
higher normal schools/women's higher normal schools
normal school order in 1943 decided that higher normal schools should train teachers for middle schools and girls' high school,while higher women's normal schools train teachers for girls' high school.
by the enactment of school education law in 1947 and national school establishment law in 1949,tokyo higher normal school and university of arts and sciences amalgamated into tokyo university of education,hiroshima higher normal school was amalgamated with various institutions including hiroshima women's higher normal school,hiroshima university of arts and science(old-system),hiroshima high school(old-system),hiroshima technical college(old-system)and promoted to hiroshima university,further both tokyo and nara women's higher normal schools were promoted to universities,ochanomizu university and nara women's university,respectively and kanazawa higher normal school became kanazawa university of education.
moreover,because of war damage,okazaki higher normal school moved from okazaki city to toyokawa city,however,without returning to okazaki city,it became a toyokawa branch of the faculty of liberal arts(now the faculty of information and culture)of nagoya university.
(the department of education of nagoya university was newly established at the start of postwar new-system universities,not descended from any normal school).
tokyo higher normal school(1886-):after the promotion to tokyo university of arts and sciences(1929),it was established as an annex to this university.
tokyo women's higher normal school
hiroshima higher normal school(1902-):after the promotion to hiroshima university of arts and sciences(old-system)(1929-),it was established as an annex to this university.

from 1943 normal schools became government-established,educational institutions to train teachers for national elementary schools at about a level of vocational schools.
