teisho tsuga
teisho tsuga(male,1718-circa.1794)was a yomihon writer,confucian scholar,and physician during the middle of edo period.
he was a good calligrapher,painter,and seal engraver.
unlike the conventional ukiyozoshi in those days,his yomihon "shigeshigeyawa" was under so strong influence of the chinese text that it clearly shows its original.
it is said that akinari ueda was enlightened by the originality of teisho's yomihon and authored "ugetsu monogatari."
accordingly,teisho tsuga is regarded as a pioneer of early modern yomihon writers.
