he wears a wig called "oji" with a deformed style of long hair,and a beard called higekazura.
his kumadori(uniquely exaggerated makeup,drawing lines)is called "kugeare," done in blue shades.
he is dressed up as above to represent a great evil because he attempts to rule the world with his superhuman power and authority.
