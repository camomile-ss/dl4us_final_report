dosho
dosho(629-april 3,700)was a priest of the hosso sect and he was born at funenomuraji,tajihi county,kawachi province(present osaka prefecture).
brief personal history
in 653 he went to tang as a member of kento-shi(japanese envoy to tang dynasty china)and learned the dharmalogy of the hosso study under genjo(xuan zang).
it is said that genjo treated this learned priest from a foreign country with respect and coached him even sharing a living room of the cell.
although there is a record that dosho learned shodaijoron kyogaku(education and leaning on the commentary of mahayana buddhism),there left no commentary on shodaijoron.
sometime during his stay in tang,he practiced zen meditation under keiman(hui man)at ryuka-ji temple(longhuasi)on the introduction of genjo,and returned to japan with some sutras and papers.
around 660 he returned to japan.
most sutras and papers brought at this time were moved to a zen temple of ukyo district in heijo-kyo after the transfer of the capital and treated as important materials.
sometime after returning,he built a zen temple in hoko-ji temple(also called asuka-dera temple or gango-ji temple),lived there,and taught the dharmalogy of the hosso study for the first time in japan(according to "nanji-den").
in 680 he built ojoin temple(sennan city)by direct order of the emperor tenmu.
in his later years,he traveled around the county and conducted public works at many regions.
when he was died in 700,he was cremated by his will for the first time in japan.
that record still remains.
gyoki was his disciple.
