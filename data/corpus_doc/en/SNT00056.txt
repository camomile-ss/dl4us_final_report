three great tenjins of japan
the three typical tenmangu shrines are collectively called as "nihon sandai tenjin" or the three great tenjins of japan.
"nihon sandai tenjin" is shortened to "nihon san tenjin."
dazaifu tenmangu shrine,kitano tenmangu shrine,and osaka tenmangu shrine are referred to as the three great tenjins of japan.
according to a different theory,the hofu tenmangu shrine or kobiragata tenmangu shrine may be included instead of the osaka tenmangu shrine.
