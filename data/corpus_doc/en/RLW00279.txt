summary
the company operated a railway line that ran along the yura river from the fukuchiyama station located in fukuchiyama city,the northern part of kyoto prefecture,to the komori station(near the oe station(kyoto prefecture)of kitakinki tango railway miyafuku line operated by kitakinki tango railway)located in oe town,kasa county(kyoto prefecture)(a part of fukuchiyama city at present).
it started business on september 22,1923.
the company name was hokutan keiben railway co.,ltd.when it was established,but it was renamed when it started business.
the company initially intended to shorten the kitakinki tango railway miyazu line from the fukuchiyama station,but it gave up to construct the line beyond the komori station because the point of the miyazu line's railway bridge was shifted towards the mouth of yura river compared to the original plan.
thereafter,japan railway construction public corporation decided to construct a line connecting miyazu station and komori station as the miyamori line,and construction work began in 1966.
the line's route was changed into the one that connects miyazu and komori almost linearly by constructing a tunnel piercing mt.oe.
however,when komori mine located along the line was closed in 1969,hokutan railway's freight service volume decreased sharply and the company faced difficulty in continuing business.
under such circumstances,the company suspended its railway operation on march 2,1971,before the completion of the miyamori line,in the name of flood control projects of yura river,and it also suspended its bus operation soon after.
the company was dissolved in 1974 when its railway line was formally abolished,and it assigned its bus business to kyoto kotsu co.,ltd(kameoka).
the miyamori line,which could have become useless after the abolition of hokutan railway,was renamed the miyafuku line in 1975 when komori(oe)-fukuchiyama section was added to its construction plan,and the construction work of this section started in 1979.
hokutan railway wanted the nation to purchase the roadbed,but it was not realized because the construction route of the miyafuku line was altered due to flood control projects of yura river.
the construction work of the miyamori line was suspended when the japan national railway reform act was enacted in 1980,but it was taken over by a joint public-private company.
the line commenced operation in 1988 as the miyafuku railway(current kitakinki tango railway)miyafuku line.
reality of railway business
while the line was constructed along the yura river,its track was laid on the riverbed due to the shortage of construction funds.
as a result,the line was frequently damaged by the flood of yura river.
as the company was always in financial difficulties until its dissolution because of chronic small traffic volume,it couldn't afford to conduct the maintenance work properly and as a result,the track was devastated.
the shape of the line's curve section was not circular but angulate,something like a curve drawn by lining up matchsticks.
the reason for the above was that spikes couldn't fix the track.
the cause of such situation was that railroad ties were corroded by mud that was piled up after ballast was washed away by a flood.
as each piece of rail that makes up a curve is straight,a curve became an angulated shape after spikes were removed.
the company couldn't afford to replace railroad ties even under such a situation,and tried to reinforce by driving small nails beside spikes.
further,the gauge became uneven because the track was not fixed,and trains sometimes went off the track.
because of such track conditions,maximum speed was limited to only 25 km/h.
as passenger cars were also aging,some old cars were warped by vibration even when they were running at such low speed.
it took 45 to 52 minutes for 12.4 km between fukuchiyama and komori(it took about 33 minutes at one time in the past).
the reason why hokutan railway,which was then in a desperate situation with the numbers of passengers continuously decreasing,continued its operation was that it expected the line's connection with the miyamori line as well as the purchase by the nation.
as of 2009,the required time between fukuchiyama and kawamori of the miyafuku line is 12 minutes at the shortest by a limited express electric train and 20 minutes by a local diesel car(stops at five stations).
