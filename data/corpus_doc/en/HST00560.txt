machi-koji street
machi-koji street was a street that was central to the townspeople of kyoto in the middle ages,and was lined with doso(underground warehouses).
summary
the predecessor of machikoji were the machijiri-koji street of heian-kyo and became shinmachi-dori street from the edo period.
geologically,it was a first-rate location in kyoto at that time because it was on high grounds that would not be affected by the flooding of the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system).
the merchant houses and factories of the craftspeople lined the street,whereas the courtiers and military families had homes east of the higashinotoin-dori street,which was more prone to flooding.
the wealthier townspeople were called 'utokunin' and paid for the yamahoko junko(procession of gion festival floats)during the gion-e(service for souls of gion)instead of the government and were called 'junya no senmin' (people of the lower class who are wealthy).
