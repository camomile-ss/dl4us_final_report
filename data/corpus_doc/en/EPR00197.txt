he was the son of emperor ninmyo.
he was at the rank of shonii(senior second rank)and the position of udaijin(the minister of the right).

he assumed the position of jiju(chamberlain),director of mimasaka province,state council,chunagon(vice-councilor of state)and dainagon(chief councilor of state).
he was one of the main culprits who delivered sugawara no michizane by colluding with fujiwara no tokihira during the reign of emperor daigo,in 901,he was appointed as udaijin to take the place of michizane.
he was called nishisanjo udaijin because of the location of his residence.
in 913,he fell into mire,was entrenched and drowned while practicing falconry.
it is said that since his body wasn't found,people feared that it was because of the "wrath of michizane's ghost."
he was posthumously awarded the rank of shoichii.
fujiwara no tadahira,who felt kindly toward michizane unlike him or tokihira,was appointed as a successor of udaijin.
a group from the minamoto clan,derived from hikaru and his brothers,was later called ninmyo-genji(minamoto clan).
