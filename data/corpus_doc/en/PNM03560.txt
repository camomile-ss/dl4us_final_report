mochinori isshiki
mochinori isshiki(dates of birth and death unknown)is a samurai(warrior)during the muromachi period.
he is the eldest child born out of wedlock of mitsunori isshiki.
his younger brothers include yoshitsura isshiki and mochinobu isshiki.
he is jiro and shikibu shoyu(junior assistant minister of the ministry of ceremonial).
he is the origin of the isshiki shikibu family.
his child was masateru isshiki.
he got one character from shogun yoshimochi ashikaga and called himself mochinori.
after his father,mitsunori,passed away on new year's day of 1409,he fought with his younger brother,yoshitsura,over the succession.
it is said that the remnants of the ogasawara clan that served as shugodai(provincial governor)of mikawa and wakasa provinces and were destroyed by mitsunori supported mochinori;however,yoshitsura won support from the bakufu and they reconciled in the end.
"wakasa shugoshiki shidai" says that the reconciliation took placed in june 1411.
according to "keizu sanyo," mochinori held the post of shugoshiki of tango province and yoshitsura held the post of shugoshiki of wakasa as a result of the reconciliation;however,this is incorrect and mochinori had never held the post of shugoshiki throughout his life.
mochinori's lineage became a hokoshu(the shogunal military guard)which is a direct army of the shogun of the muromachi bakufu and became a hatamoto(direct retainers)of the edo bakufu after serving nobunaga oda and hideyoshi toyotomi..
