fubutsushi(a poetic expression for certain events or things)
fubutsushi means events or things unique to a season--natural phenomena,tastes,living things,and street vendors--that characterize the season in people's mind.
fubutsushi covers a wide range of things and differs from words restricted as kigo(a season word)for haiku(japanese seventeen-syllable poem)in that fubutsushi refers to things with which a season in japan appeals to the mind of our modern people.
fubutsushi also commonly ranges from things found nationwide to things in a limited region such as festivals and is used to express the coming of a season and seasonal turning points.
