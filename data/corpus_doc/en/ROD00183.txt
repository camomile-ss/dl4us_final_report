gokomachi-dori street
gokomachi-dori street is one of the streets in kyoto city that run in the north-south direction.
it is one block west of teramachi-dori street and stretches from marutamachi-dori street to the north and gojo-dori street to the south.
it did not exist when the city was heian-kyo but was newly build by hideyoshi toyotomo under tensho no jiwari land allotment plan.
the origin of the street name remains unclear;one theory is that the name derives from hideyoshi having traveled the street when paying a visit to the imperial court from osaka(or fushimi).
the street between sanjo-dori and shijo-dori streets has many cultural facilities,such as art complex 1928 in sanjo gokomachi,and shops catering to young people.
