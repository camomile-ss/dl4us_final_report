his empress was fumiwara no yorimichi's daughter,fujiwara no kanshi,but the emperor died without having any children with her.

empresses,princes and princesses
there was only one example of having sango heiritsu(having three empresses at the same time)during the emperor goreizei's reign.
emperor goreizei was the only emperor having three empresses at the same time,although later on emperor toba,emperor nijo and emperor gohorikawa had three empresses,including the second consort of the emperor.
first,shoshi officially became an empress followed by kanshi,and in the natural manner shoshi would have become the empress and kanshi being the second consort of the emperor;however,due to shoshi's request kanshi became the empress and shoshi was kept as the second consort of the emperor.
subsequently,before the emperor died kanshi officially became the third empress,and on this occasion,second consort of the emperor,shoshi,became the empress dowager and the empress kanshi became the second consort of the emperor,and the last kanshi became the empress.
it is considered that this was decided in order by which the three empresses made their imperial consort's bridal entries into the court.
the second consort of the emperor:princess shoshi(1026-1105)-emperor go-ichijo's first princess
empress:fujiwara no kanshi(1036-1127)-the chancellor(chief advisor to the emperor),fujiwara no yorimichi's eldest daughter
