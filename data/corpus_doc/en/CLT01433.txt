burabura
burabura is a lantern specter and one of japanese yokai(ghosts,spirits and monsters)that was portrayed in sekien toriyama's yokai art collection book: "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (the bag of one hundred random demons;the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki,replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough,most of the yokais shown in this book are tsukumogami[a type of japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]).
according to sekien's commentary in the "hyakki tsurezure bukuro," the burabura looks like a lantern light,however,it is actually believed to be a kitsune-bi(a japanese will-o'-the-wisp).
there are few references on lore of the lantern yokai despite its popularity.
however,the lantern yokai has often been reported not as a chochin obake(literally,lantern ghost)but as a fire of mysterious or suspicious origin,such as the kitsune-bi and chochin-bi(lantern light).
since it is portrayed as a yokai of items and artifacts,some say that it should not be considered as a kitsune-bi yokai as described in the commentary but as a variation of the so-called chochin obake.
