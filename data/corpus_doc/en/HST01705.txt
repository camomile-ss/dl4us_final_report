english minister,harry parks mediated for the conclusion of this treaty,and among all the unfair treaties concluded between the edo government and the meiji government with europe and the north america since the ansei era treaty,the treaty contained the most advantageous conditions,the contents of which applied to all countries who had made "most favored nation treatment" treaties with japan.
especially in the field of consular jurisdiction,it turned out to contain the most unfavorable regulations for japan and was consequently applied to other western great powers as well

the regulation that used to designate kanagawa-juku as an open port was modified for the first time to yokohama bay,which was the actual open port.
