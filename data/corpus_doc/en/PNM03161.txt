sanemoto goto
sanemoto goto(year of birth and death unknown)is a military commander who lived during the last days of the heian period.
he was the son of fujiwara no sanetoo,a descendant of fujiwara no hidesato,one of the imperial palace guards for the north side.
he called himself hyoe no jo(lieutenant of the middle palace guards).
he served minamoto no yoshitomo in kyoto and he followed minamoto no yorihira,the son of yoshitomo,in the heiji war.
what he did after the heiji war is not clear;however,according to "the heiji monogatari" (the tale of the heiji)he brought up bomonhime,the daughter of yoshitomo,in kyoto(later she became the lawful wife of yoshiyasu ichijyo).
when minamoto no yoritomo,the bereaved child of yoshitomo raised his army in 1180,sanemoto participated in the army with motokiyo goto,his adopted son.
he joined the army of the minamoto no yoshitsune in the fight to hunt down and kill ise-heishi(taira clan);at the battle of yashima,he demonstrated his prowess as a warrior;for example,he burned down the fortress after the taira's army escaped to the sea and made the taira's army give up the will to counterattack.
it is also said that he recommended nasu no yoichi as an archer to shoot at a fan on top of the mast of a taira ship and he was praised for his being accurate in sizing up the ability of soldiers.
