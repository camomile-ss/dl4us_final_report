shinmachi-dori street
the shinmachi-dori street is one of the major north-south running streets of kyoto city.
it extends from the geni-dori street in the north to kuzebashi-dori street in the south,though it is divided by kyoto station.
it corresponds to the machi-koji(machijiri-koji street)of heiankyo.
the reason why the name was changed from machi-koji street to shinmachi-dori street is unknown.
it runs along the eastern edge of kyoto prefectural head office and the western edge of higashi hongan-ji temple.
during the gion festival,the street is the last parade route taken by yamahoko,gion festival floats:all floats carried west along oike-dori street turn south along shinmachi-dori street and return to their own hokocho(towns with hoko,float).
this is why the street has no electric wires crossing the street.
