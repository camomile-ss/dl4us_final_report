shudenryo(bureau of grounds)
shudenryo,also referred to as tonomori no tsukasa,refers to an institution that belonged to kunaisho(imperial household ministry)in the ritsuryo system(a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)of japan adopting the ritsuryo system.
主殿寮(chinese characters of shudenryo)was also read as tonomoryo and tonomorizukasa.
official duties
major official duties of shudenryo were to manage and provide supplies in daidairi(the greater imperial palace).
since the facilities administration business especially required many workers,a large number of workers including kushicho(general workers),konryo(odd-job men)and so on belonged to it.
its official duties partially overlapped those of kamonryo(bureau of housekeeping).
in 808,it amalgamated with kannushi(an office that belonged to the imperial household ministry under the ritsuryo system,which administered kubunden[the farm land given to each farmer]and meiseki[cards that showed official ranks,names and ages]),and also managed kannuhi(government-owned slaves)and kanko(slaves to public ministries).

afterwards,the post of kami(director)was succeeded and inherited by the ozuki clan.
