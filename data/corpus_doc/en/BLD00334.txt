kyoto nishikyogoku athletic park supplementary field
kyoto nishikyogoku athletic park supplementary field is a subfield of the kyoto nishikyogoku athletic stadium in ukyo ward,kyoto city,kyoto prefecture,and is owned and managed by kyoto city.
the supplementary field,as well as the main stadium,was on the official candidate list for the 2002 fifa world cup training camps.
front-row seats are arranged on almost the same level as the field and there is no fence between the seats and the field.
seats are not angled,nor are they elevated,so the supplementary field may not be an ideal place to watch the games.
