with the downfall of the saito clan,sekian became nobunaga oda's secretary.
as a private secretary he worked closely with nobunaga not only on administrative matters but also on external issues with shingen takeda and due to a particularly amicable relationship with the mouri family,takei was appointed by nobunaga and actively involved in negotiations between takakage kobayakawa and motoharu kikkawa etc.
