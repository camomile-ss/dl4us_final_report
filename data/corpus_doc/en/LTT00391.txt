fuji no uraba(wisteria leaves)
fuji no uraba is one of the 54 chapters of "the tale of genji."
it is the 33rd chapter.

summary
hikaru genji,age 39.
in april,the minister of the palace held a flower festival at his residence,and approved a marriage between his daughter,kumoi no kari,and yugiri,who had been in love with each other for a long time.
both hikaru genji and the minister of the palace were pleased with the happy newlyweds.
meanwhile,it was decided that hikaru genji's daughter,young lady akashi,would enter the imperial court.
murasaki no ue gave up the role of guardian to lady akashi,the birth mother.
the two mothers first met when their daughter entered the imperial court as a bride,and they changed positions with each other.
they saw each other's virtues and approved of each other,so there was no ill feeling and they reached an understanding.
in autumn,hikaru genji,approaching his 40th birthday celebration,came to be treated as jun daijo tenno(quasi ex-emperor)and the minister of the palace got promoted to daijo daijin(grand minister of state).
in november,emperor reizei and emperor suzaku went to the rokujo-in palace together,where a splendid banquet was held.
and thus,the prophecy that hikaru genji was told by someone from goryeo when he was a boy came true,and he was in the height of his prosperity.
