chokugan-ji temples
chokugan-ji temples were temples for prayer founded at the will of the emperors and the retired emperors of the time to pray for the protection of the nation and the prosperity of the imperial household.
in reality,there are also many temples that were made chokugan-ji temples by imperial sanction after their founding.
a temple designated as a chokugan-ji temple could also receive land,and there had been cases since the sengoku period(period of warring states)of temples that tried to achieve the status for this reason.
the chokugan-ji temple designation was used until the early meiji period but was abolished under the edict ordering the separation of shinto and buddhism.
