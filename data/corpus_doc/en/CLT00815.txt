yoshuku geino
in seeing the traditional perfuming arts from a religious point of view,yoshuku geino refers to various performing arts for celebrating the new year such as manzai(a traditional celebratory chant-like song)or harukoma(a dance in which a performer carries a wooden horse's head),and ta asobi or onda,a performance mimicking the processes of rice production to pray for a good harvest before farm work starts.
celebrating beforehand is the way to pray for the realization of wishes;this is based on the belief and the concept of kotodama(soul or power of language).
the same goes for shishimai(a ritual dance by a performer wearing a lion's mask)and 'yashikibome' (a celebratory chant-like song for residence)performed with a furyu dance(a folk dance).
in contrast to yoshuku geino,the traditional performing arts that emphasize warding off disasters are sometimes called josai geino(public entertainment for removal of disasters).
