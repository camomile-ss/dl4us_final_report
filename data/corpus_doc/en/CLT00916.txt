tanzaku
tanzaku means paper cut into strips,or thin slices of wood.
mostly it is used to write words on,or attached to various things as a sign or marking.
although its main purpose today is to write wishes on as a part of the tanabata festival(the star festival celebrated on the seventh of july),actually thick and decorated pieces of paper,on which tanka and haiku poems are written,are also a kind of tanzaku.
