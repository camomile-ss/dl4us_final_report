summary
the terado otsuka-kofun tumulus is one of the tumuli in muko-kyuryo hills.
it appears to have been constructed in the middle of the early kofun(tumulus)period.
it is slightly tilted west with a pit rock chamber in both the front square and the back circular part.
a triangular-rimmed mirror excavated in the tumulus seems to be in an isomorphic relationship with the one from the tsubai otsukayama-kofun tumulus.
this suggests that the one who was buried in the terado otsuka-kofun tumulus may have been a subject of the person buried in the tsubai otsukayama-kofun tumulus.
most of the front part is lost as earth has been added to the bamboo forest.
at the top of the mound there is an eight meters square site lined with haniwa clay figures,immediately below where the stone chamber lies.
the tumulus has an offering place for haji pottery.
