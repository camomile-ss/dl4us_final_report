iden refers to the rice fields which were given to the ones higher than goi(fifth rank)in the rank and the imperial family,depending on the rank or honi(court rank)in the ritsuryo system(a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)in japan.
it was regarded as yusoden(rice field subject to taxation)which was obliged to pay tax of soyocho(a tax system,corvee).
and the rice fields which were provided depending on honi were also called honden(a rice field that was given based on one's official rank).
