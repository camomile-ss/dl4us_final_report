minamoto no tamemitsu
minamoto no tamemitsu(year of birth and death unknown)was a busho(japanese military commander)in the late heian period.
he was the eldest son of minamoto no mitsukuni,kai no kuni no kami(governor of kai province).
his wives included a daughter of minamoto no yorinobu,kawachi no kuni no kami(governor of kawachi province)and so on.
his children included minamoto no tametomo.
his official court rank was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and he filled the post of kai no kuni no kami("sonpi bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]).
he married a daughter of kawachi-genji(minamoto clan),yorinobu and had his legitimate child,tametomo.
in view of the fact that only tamemitsu was confirmed as a person on whom a peerage was conferred during this period among descendants of minamoto no mitsuyoshi,it is presumed that he was active in kyoto as a direct descendant of mitsuyoshi.
although he is said to have filled the post of kai no kami(the governor of kai province)and so on as his father had done,no details of his record of offices and ranks held and his achievements are known.
