on september 8,1832,he made an courtesy visited to tameyori sanyo prior to the departure toward tsu in ise province,but he did not know that sanyo was on his deathbed.
he argued the history and insistently advocated the theories of legitimacy of the northern court,saying, 'now that the present imperial court is from the northern court lineage,you are a retainer of the northern court,aren't you?' and these words provoked sanyo's anger.
