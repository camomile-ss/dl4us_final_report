yoritugu oguni
yoritugu(yoritsura)oguni(the date of birth and death unknown)was a busho(japanese military commander)and gokenin(shogunal retainer)in the early kamakura period.
he was the head of the oguni clan,a local ruling family,who headquartered in kokuniyasu,kariwa-gun,echigo province.
his father was minamoto no muneyori(momozono hyoe taifu).
his imina(personal name)was yoritsugu.
his go(pen name)was saburo genbe.
he had a child yoritaka oguni.
in the first month of 1212,he was chosen to be the first archer in the yumi-hajime(an archery ceremony)in front of the shogun minamoto no sanetomo,but had not brought a bow,so he took up the rough wooden bow he was given and displayed his great strength as well as his surpassing skill in archery.
as a result,sanetomo,who was impressed with his archery display,granted him jito-shiki(stewardship rights)to inazuho in echizen province(according to the entry in the "azuma kagami" for the eleventh day of the first month of the same year).
during the jokyu war,he took the side of the bakufu and joined the army of tomotoki hojo that advanced along the hokuriku-do road(article dated june 8,1221,in "azuma kagami" [the mirror of the east]).
