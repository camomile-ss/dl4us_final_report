mihotsu-hime
"mihotsu-hime" is a god(shinto)appearing in japanese mythology.
she is the daughter of takamimusubi no kami,and the empress of omononushi or okuninushi.
she appears only in one document in the second part of the scene of ashihara no nakatsukuniheitei in the "nihon shoki" (chronicles of japan).
after onamuchi no kami(okuninushi)decided on moving over to the province and hid in the realm of the dead,takamimusubi no kami said to omononushi no kami(aramitama and nigimitama of okuninushi), 'if you are taking kunitsu kami as your wife,it means you haven't surrendered your soul yet.
take my daughter,mihotsu-hime,as your wife,and lead the yaoyorozu no kami to eternally surrender your soul to the imperial descendants.
the 'tsu' in mihotsu-hime means 'no,' and it means goddess of miho.
she is enshrined in the miho-jinja shrine in izumo province(matsue city,shimane prefecture),together with kotoshironushi,who is the child of okuninushi no kami.
at the izumo-daijingu shrine in tanba(kameoka city,kyoto prefecture),she is the main goddess worshipped along with okuninushi no kami,and is considered the empress of okuninushi no kami.
at the murayaniimasumifutsuhime-jinja shrine(tawaramoto-cho,shiki-gun,nara prefecture),she is the main goddess worshipped along with omononushi no kami,and is considered the empress of omononushi no kami.
