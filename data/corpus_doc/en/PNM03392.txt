hata no ushi
hata no ushi(year of birth and death unknown)was a person who lived during japan's asuka period.
his name is pronounced the same in the old japanese kana syllabary.
his kabane(hereditary title)was kimi.
in the jinshin war of 672,he switched to the side of prince oama(emperor tenmu).
ushi was a child of hata no yakuni.
when the jinshin war broke out,he joined an army with his father as one of tens of thousands of troops led by yamabe no okimi(prince yamabe),soga no hatayasu and kose no hito(巨勢比等)(also written巨勢人).
although this army marched along the east coast of biwa-ko lake to attack the prince oama's headquarters in fuwa county,mino province,it stopped in confusion because yamabe no okimi was killed by the other two commanders around august 3.
at that time,shogun of the omi imperial court,hata no kimi yakuni,and his child,hata no ushi,switched to the side of prince oama with their own troops.
yakuni was ordered to immediately go to hokuetsu(the north region of koshi province),and captured mionoki castle on august 23.
there are no other records about ushi.
