summary
it is described in 'dairi-shiki' as 'two of kencho no myobu,' 'naishin-nou以下sanmi已上為之' and '若無者王氏shii goi yakutoku.'
later,women of the o clan who were the jingi-haku(administrator of the institution for dedicating to religious ceremony)were appointed as kencho and they were called queen of kencho(imperial family).
after people were seated,two of kencho separated to right and left and entered through the east or the west door on the north face and then took a seat.
after emperor was seated in takamikura throne,nine of hatori nyoju(noblewomen)on the right and left sides respectively shielded him from view with sashiha(long-handled,chinese style fans)and kencho-no-myobu went up the stairs on the east and west sides,and then raised tobari(curtain)of takamikura.
tobari was partly raised on the south side,and minor court ladies helped it from inside as they fixed the edge of the tobari in the shape of the chinese character for eight with needles.
after a ceremony finished,hatori nyoju shielded emperor with sashiha again and hung tobari,and then he returned to gobou(temple).
