after nakakane itsutsuji(year of birth and death unknown)the family name was changed to the itsutsuji.
nakakane itsutsuji was a jigenin(a lower rank of ancient japanese nobility)who served at kurododokoro(chamberlain's office)and hokumen no bushi(the imperial palace guards for the north side).
however,after moronaka itsutsuji(jusanmi-junior third rank)and jibusho(the ministry of civil administration)(1487-1540)was given the rank of jusanmi in 1538,the family was added as a toshoke family(hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank).
