kimekomi ningyo dolls
kimekomi ningyo is a type of wooden doll.
to make a kimekomi ningyo,first,thin lines are carved to represent wrinkles and patterns on the doll body which is made of wood or toso(made from the mixture of sawdust of paulownia wood and wheat starch or other sticky materials.
then pieces of fabric are tucked into the carved grooves using an eyelet to make the doll look like it is wearing clothes.
the name 'kimekomi' came from the japanese verb that describes the action of squeezing a piece of fabric into the wood grooves, 'kimekomu,' which can be written with different chinese characters to give different meaning, 'determined.'
some dolls are made all from toso;other dolls are made by inserting a head,which was made separately,into the completed torso.
when the head is made separately,eyes are often drawn rather than inserting glass eyes.
it is considered that kimekomi doll originated when tadashige takahashi,an odd-job man who was working for kamigamo-jinja shrine,kyoto prefecture,started making dolls using fabric tucked into a pieces of wood.
besides human-shaped dolls,such as hina dolls(dolls displayed for the girl's festival)or shichifukujin(seven deities of good fortune),there are chinese zodiac ornaments and ornamental temari(a ball of cotton wound tightly around with threads of many colors).
