kudara no okimi(imperial family)
kudara no okimi,also referred to as kudara no miko(year of birth and death unknown)was in the imperial family in the asuka period.
he was a grandchild of emperor bidatsu("shinsen shojiroku" [newly compiled register of clan names and titles of nobility]).
it is assumed that his father was oshisaka no hikohito no oenomiko.
he is also called the imperial prince kudara.
in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters),there was no name of kudara no okimi in oshisaka no hikohito no oenomiko's genealogy in the emperor bidatsu's section,it is highly possible that the kudara no okimi was tara no miko(a younger brother-uterine of the emperor jomei)who was born to nukadehime no himemiko('ku' in 'kutara no miko' may have been dropped?);on the other hand,there is another theory saying that he was kinu no miko(the father of the emperor kogyoku and the emperor kotoku)born to omata no miko.
since only his genealogy and name were recorded in "shojiroku" (register of clan names and titles of nobility),his achievements was unknown.
according to the shojiroku,he was the ancestor of these clans:the ohara clan,the shiane no mahito,the toyonokuni no mahito,the yamao no mahito,the yoshino no mahito,the kuwata no mahito,the ikegami clan,the unakami no mahito,the kiyohara no mahito and the ikegami no kurahito.
