summary
hikaru genji,from the winter of his 36th year to february of his 37th.
in december,emperor reizei visited oharano,and tamakazura joined the party,too.
tamakazura saw her father,to no chujo(the first secretary's captain),for the first time,but she was more fascinated by the beauty of emperor reizei,who looked exactly like genji.
genji recommended tamakazura's serving as naishi no tsukasa(female palace attendant),as if he had seen straight through her.
while genji hurried to prepare for tamakazura's mogi(coming-of-age ceremony for girls),he asked her biological father,minister of the palace,to act as koshi-yui(one who ties a band around the young woman's waist in the ceremony).
the minister of the palace,however,did not know the truth,and he declined,citing the illness of his mother,omiya.
so genji visited omiya on his own initiative,and he confessed to her and the minister of the palace who tamakazura was.
the minister of the palace was then willing to take the role of koshi-yui,and on the day of mogi,the father and daughter finally met each other.
before long,people found out the truth,and omi no kimi was ridiculed more than ever because she envied tamakazura,who was beloved by all.
