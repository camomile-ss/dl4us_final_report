ichiju-issai(a bowl of soup and one dish)
"ichiju-issai" is one of the menu compositions of meals in japan.
staple food
-white rice,etc.
soup dish
-miso soup,etc.
okazu(also called sozai)one dish
tsukemono(also called ko no mono)(pickles)
these four categories are eaten together.
the items excluding the staple food constitute 'ichiju-issai,' because ko no mono is not usually counted.
the composition of 'ichiju-sansai' that has three dishes(one main dish+two side dishes)is also well known.
the word ichiju-issai was used to mean 'a simple meal' (also called soshoku)comprising only one dish.
however,it has acquired a rather positive meaning with the westernization of dietary habits and food satiation are becoming a problem in recent years.
and,it has been used largely to signify 'a well-balanced meal' that follows a traditional japanese style.
history
ichiju-issai originally meant a meal style emphasizing simplicity and frugality that had been taken in zen temples in the kamakura period.
thus,okazu was also extremely simple,prepared with vegetables.
(however, 'ichiju-sansai' was served on a special occasion and when there was a visitor).
this meal style spread among ordinary people.
then,ichiju-issai and ichiju-sansai eventually came to establish themselves as the traditional daily meal patterns of japan.
it is known that yozan uesugi and mitsumasa ikeda ordered people to make their meals ichiju-issai for the sake of frugality during the edo period.
