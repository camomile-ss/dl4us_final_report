matsudai and faith in mt.fuji
as a person who performed mountain ascetic practices on mt.fuji and constructed buddhist termples there,matsudai is thought to be the founder of mt.fuji shugendo.
in 1149,he built a buddhist temple called dainichi-ji temple on the top of mt.fuji to enshrine dainichi nyorai(mahavairocana).
he then built a buddhist temple called dainichi-do in murayama(present-day fujinomiya city,shizuoka prefecture).
since then murayama became the center of mt.fuji shugendo,which is the reason that matsudai is considered its founder.
