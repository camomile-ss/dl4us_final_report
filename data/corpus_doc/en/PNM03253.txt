enkei(priest)
enkei(dates of birth and death unknown)was a buddhist priest in the nara period.
no details are known about his origin.
in 753,he guided ganjin,who came to japan from tang,to dazaifu,kyushu,and served as an interpreter for ganjin when this reverend priest went to kyoto in the following year 754.
according to a document stored in the shoso-in treasure repository,enkei lent "kegon-kyo" (avatamsaka sutra)in 755 and "matoga-kyo" (mātaṅgī-sūtra)in 756 to the sutra copying office of todai-ji temple.
in 758,he rejected the awarding of a court rank ge-jugoinoge(jugoinoge[junior fifth rank,lower grade]given to persons outside kyoto)because of his being a priest,but ikuro(stipends paid to people who were in the fourth rank and the fifth rank)and iden(fields given according to the court rank)were not confiscated due to the imperial command.
"muchimaro-den" (the life of muchimaro),which is the second volume of "toshi kaden" (biographies of the fujiwara clan),is said to have been compiled by enkei.
