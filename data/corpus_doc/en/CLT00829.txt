nagashi-bina
nagashi-bina(paper dolls floated downriver)is an event which is said to be the origin of the dolls' festival.
it is also called 'hina-nagashi.'
this ceremony is still held in various regions as a folk custom which represents the removal of participants' impurities by throwing them into a river,in the same way as harai-hitogata(purification with a paper doll).
origin
it has such a long history that appears in the chapter of suma in the 'genji monogatari' (the tale of genji).
the story is that hikaru genji put a purified hitogata(also called katashiro,which is a paper doll used in shinto purification rites)on a boat and washed it out to the sea of suma.
