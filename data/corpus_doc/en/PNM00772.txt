in march 1185,he was captured in dan no ura
he was exiled to suo province,but tried to avoid going to haisho(the place where a criminal is sent)by becoming related with minamoto no yoshitsune.
in november,when yoshitsune had to leave the capital after a conflict with minamoto no yoritomo,tokizane accompanied him but separated in daimotsu-ura in settsu province due to the ship capsizing,and then concealed himself in the capital.

in 1189,he was released and returned to the capital.
in 1211,he was granted jusami(junior third rank).
"genpei seisui ki" (rise and fall of the minamoto and the taira clans)rated him as 'having a brave spirit,' although he was a kuge(court noble).
