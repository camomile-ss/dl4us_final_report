kuki-cha(twig tea)
kuki-cha is one of japanese green teas.
it is also called bocha.
this tea is made by mixing burgeons,footstalks,stems of sprouts taken from a tea plant(camellia sinensis).
it can also be produced by collecting stems removed during the process of non-powdered green tea or powdered green tea production.
kuki-cha can also be produced from gyokuro(refined green tea).
such a high-grade tea is especially called karigane or shiraore twig tea.
by roasting kuki-cha,hojicha(roasted green tea)may also be created.
it is savory(aromatic)and creamy,and has a mild taste.
it is considered appropriate to brew for 3 minutes in hot water at 70 to 80 degrees c(celsius)or 155 to 180 degrees f(fahrenheit).
if it takes too much time for brewing or the temperature of the hot water is too high,it will have a bad taste(which is common in any tea to some extent).
it is also used for macrobiotics,and may be used in mixture with juice.
