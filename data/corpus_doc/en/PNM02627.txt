kudara no otara
according to the article of november,501 of nihonshoki(chronicles of japan),kudara no otara is described as follows.
kudara no otara died this month and was buried on the hill of takadanooka.'
although nothing else about him is described in nihonshoki,it is believed that he was a member of the royal family of paekche(a kingdom in early korea)because his age of death and the location of his burial are recorded in nihonshoki.
(please refer to nihonshoki(vol.2)in the iwanami japanese classic literature systematic edition)
if this is true,it is highly likely that otara was related to konki o(konikishi),the king of paekche's young brother who visited japan in 461.
according to samguk saki(history of the three kingdoms), 'konki,naishin sahei(a government post),died' in 477,which suggests that he returned to paekche.
however,given that asuka-jinja shrine(engishikimyojin-taisha shrine)in habikino city,osaka prefecture,enshrines konki o as its deity,there is no doubt that his descendants remained in japan even after konki o's departure.
also,according to samguk sagi,tama o,a son of konki o,was enthroned as dongseong of baekje and still on the throne when kudara no otara died in japan.
it means there is a possibility that kudara no otara was a younger brother of dongseong of baekje and stayed in japan.
although the tomb of otara has not been discovered yet,a small mound standing close to the tsukiyama tumulus in tsukiyama in yamatotakada city,nara prefecture,tumulus which is believed to be the mausoleum of the emperor buretsu,or one of the mounds near the ryokeyama tomb can be a good candidate.
it is also interesting that there is an area called 'kudara' (paekche in japanese)in koryo-cho,kita-katsuragi county,adjacent to yamato-takada city.
