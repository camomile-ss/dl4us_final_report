fujiara no norinaga
fujiara no norinaga(1109-1180)was a noble who lived during the late heian period.
he was the fourth son of fujiwara no yorisuke,who was the founder of nanba-asukai school and gon dainagon(provisional chief councilor of state).
his mother was a daughter of minamoto no toshiaki,who was minbukyo(minister of popular affairs).
fujiwara no yorisuke,who was gyobukyo(minister of justice),was his younger brother from a different mother.
while he held various positions such as uchujo(middle captain of the right division of inner palace guards),sangi(royal advisors)and sakyo no daibu(master of the eastern capital offices)in succession,he was known as a tanka poet and a person with good handwriting and he taught penmanship to fujiwara no tadamichi.
he was promoted smoothly and achieved shosanmi(senior third rank)in 1149,the highest position he ever attained.
on the occasion of the hogen war in 1156,he joined the plot of the retired emperor sutoku and fujiwara no yorinaga.
he played a leading role and,repeatedly tried to persuade minamoto no tameyoshi and succeeded in making him join his side.
after the defeat of the retired emperor,he became a priest(his homyo(buddhist name)was shinren or kanren)and surrendered,signaling his allegiance,but he was not forgiven and exiled to hitachi province.
in 1162,six years after the war,he was called back to the capital and entered mt.koya.
later,in the angen era(1175 through 1177),when serious incidents such as the shishigatani affair and the great fire of angen occurred in n succession,he reportedly insisted worshiping sutoku and yorinaga as gods to calm their divine wrath..
he left collections including "shui kokin wakashu" and "hindoshu" and works such as "kokinshuchu" and "saiyosho" (teachings on calligraphy).
