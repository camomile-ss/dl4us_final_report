he was the biological father of shinzei(fujiwara no michinori)who held the reins of power as in no kinshin(the retired emperor's courtier)during the insei period(during a period governed by a retired emperor).
he started serving emperor toba before he ascended the throne and allowed access to togu(the crown prince's palace)in 1103.
