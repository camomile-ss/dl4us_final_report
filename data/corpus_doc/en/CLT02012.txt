himeii method
himeii method is one of modern japanese sake production methods and a kind of high-temperature saccharification method.
it refers to the computer-controlled japanese sake production system developed and marketed by satomi industries,ltd.
it is a significant characteristic of this system that,like yumai method(the brewing method wherein rice is reduced to a gruel-like consistency to enable saccharification to proceed apace)and baisho method(the brewing method wherein rice is heated in hot air[about 200400 degrees celsius]),japanese sake is considered as a modern industrial product rather than a traditional artifact.
summary
in contrast to kowaii(steamed rice)which is rice steamed in a koshiki(a kind of earthenware),himeii itself refers to soft rice boiled in a kiln;however,himeii method which is named after himeii has not traditionally existed.
also,the ancient japanese high-temperature saccharification method in the history of japanese sake described in "engi-shiki"(detailed enforcement regulations of the engi era)is not directly related to the modern himeii method.
