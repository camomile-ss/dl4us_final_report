takashina no tuneshige
takashina no tuneshige(year of birth and death unknown)was an official serving the imperial court in the heian period.
his post was mutsu no kami(the governor of mutsu province).
tsuneshige claimed that he was a descendant of takashina no mahito,a descendant of prince takechi,the son of emperor temmu.
according to mutsu waki(a tale of mutsu),tuneshige was appointed to be the successor to minamoto no yoritomo as mutsu no kami in 1062 and "galloped off kyoto by whipping horse" to subdue uprisings of the abe clan.
it continues that after arriving in mutsu province,however,he encountered the disobeyal of gunji(a district manager)and subjects and "returned to kyoto helplessly."
he was discharged immediately,which resulted in the confusion in the imperial court,but was reappointed as mutsu no kami partly because successor candidates declined an offer.
