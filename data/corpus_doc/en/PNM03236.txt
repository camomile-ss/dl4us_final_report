she is known to have been called oosuke.
her father was hirofusa seikanji,a dainagon(chief councilor).
she first served in the imperial court as a koto no naishi(a court noble lady)and then went to edo to become a joro(high rank woman servant in the imperial court)by introduction of uemon no suke no tsubone,a head of o-oku(the inner halls of edo castle where the wife of the shogun and her servants reside)in jokyo era(1684-1688).
then she won the fifth shogun tsunayoshi tokugawa's favor and became his sokushitsu.
after tsunayoshi's death in 1709,she shaved her head to become a priest and called herself as jukoin.
