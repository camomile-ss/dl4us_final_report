toshinaga oda
toshinaga oda(dates of birth and death unknown)was busho(japanese military commander)in the sengoku period(period of warring states).
he was the third son of nagamasu oda.
he was commonly known as uemon no suke(assistant captain of the right division of outer palace guards).
in accordance with the wishes of his father,nagamasu,he became a priest.
he lived in the daiun-in of the myoshin-ji temple in kyoto.
however,he returned to secular life without his father's consent and that broke up their relationship.
he had no lawful wife.
nagatsugu was his eldest son.
according to 'genealogy of the yamatoyanagimoto oda family,' his descendants,such as his grandson,norinaga,were identified.
a fudal retainer claiming to be a descendant of toshinaga oda was found in the nabeshima family in the kashima domain of the hizen province.
according to the story handed down in the family,he went away from kyoto accompanying the kazanin clan who was supposed to marry off a girl to naotomo nabeshima,the lord of the kashima domain of the hizen province.
with the death of his father,nagamasu,(and the confiscation of his retirement stipend),he remained and served the said family.
however,naotomo nabeshima was born in 1622,one year after the death of his father,nagamasu;the above-mentioned story lacks credibility.
