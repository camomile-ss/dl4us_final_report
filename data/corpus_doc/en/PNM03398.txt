sugawara no furuhito
sugawara no furuhito(years of birth and death unknown)was a nobleman who lived in nara and heian periods.
furuhito's father was haji no ukiniwa.
furuhito's son was sugawara no kiyokimi(alternatively called kiyotomo).
in 781,the imperial court granted furuhito a leave for the use of kabane(hereditary title used in ancient japan to denote rank and political standing)of the 'sugawara' clan.
academically superior,furuhito's career included:kokushi(provincial governor)of totoumi province,monjo(or monzo)hakase(professor of literature),and daigaku no kami(director of the bureau of education which was called in japanese daigakuryo,otsukasa or fumiyatsukasa).
furuhito was indifferent to anything other than his academic interests,and therefore,the sugawara family was financially supported by the court,despite his successful career.
