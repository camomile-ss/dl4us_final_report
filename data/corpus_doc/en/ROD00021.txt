hachijo-dori street is one of the major east-west streets in kyoto city.
it corresponds to the hachijo-oji street of heian-kyo.
it runs east-west,linking the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)and the katsura-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)nearly throughout,with the section between onmae-dori street and senbon-dori street divided by the tracks(railway)of the tokaido main line.
with the opening of the tokaido shinkansen,the four-lane street south of kyoto station has become busy.
nyakuichi-jinja shrine is located at the corner of nishioji hachijo,where a monument indicates it as the historic site of hachijo-dono(the residence in hachijo)of taira no kiyomori.
a camphor tree on the side of the street has a story;the tracks of the kyoto city trams were laid out in order to avoid the tree for fear that cutting it down might invoke a curse of taira no kiyomori.
this is why nishioji-dori street is a winding one,particularly in this section,even after the abolishment of the city trams.
