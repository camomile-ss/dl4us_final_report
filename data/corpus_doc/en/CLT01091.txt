habutae(a kind of woven silk fabric)
"habutae" (habutae silk in english)is a kind of plain woven cloth with warp and weft yarns alternately interwoven.
when the material is silk,it is called kokinu.
while an ordinary plain weave uses warp and weft yarns of the same thickness,habutae is woven using two thinner warp yarns for each one weft yarn so that its texture becomes soft,light and with silky glaze.
because of its whiteness with more than good feeling,habutae is used as the highest class liners for wafuku(japanese kimono garment)and even as the fabric for formal dresses.
habutae represents all japanese silk fabrics,as being said "the taste of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it."
