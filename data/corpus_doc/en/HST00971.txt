kurofune(the black ships)
kurofune is a term used to refer to large,western-style sea vessels,used before the edo period until the modern age.
the term is presently used to refer to ships that came to japan during the late edo period.
the term is mostly associated with the fleet of united states navy ships,led by matthew perry,that arrived off the coast of uraga in 1853.
perry's squadron
western ships of that day were called "black ships" because of the tar that was applied to the body of the ship.
because perry's squadron included a steamship,many associate the term "black ships" with steamships,but it also refers to the sail ships.
today,the term is used at times to symbolize external pressure on japan,such as by capitalist powers,or entry of foreign capital in the country that can destroy existing conventions.
