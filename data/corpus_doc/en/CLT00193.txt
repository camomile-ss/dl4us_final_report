somin shorai(a japanese old story about a folk religion)
somin shorai refers to a folk tale that has been told as a legend in japan in mainly the kinki region,referring to folk beliefs that originated in the folk tale.
looking at the past,somin shorai was founded in susano-jinja shrine(fukuyama city)in itsubun(a composition previously existed but doesn't exist now)of "bingo-koku fudoki" (regional gazetteers of bingo province)quoted in "shaku nihongi;" an annotated text of the nihon shoki,(kanekata urabe,during the middle of the kamakura period).
it has also been widely spread as saishi kigen tan(story of ritual origin)almost in a similar way.
according to the tale,muto shin(deity with clear roots in the korean peninsula)had asked his wealthy younger brother,shorai,for the place to sleep during his journey and had been refused;muto shin asked his poor brother,somin shorai as well,and somin shorai treated him even in a poor way.
muto shin who revisited his younger brother,shorai,put a ring of chigaya(japanese blood grass)as a mark on somin's daughter who became the wife of his younger brother,shorai,and destroyed shorai's family members except for her.
muto shin called himself susano no mikoto(susano),and taught that putting a ring of chigaya(japanese blood grass)enables us to avoid diseases.
based on this episode,rituals such as chinowa kuguri;going through a ring of chigaya,distribution of talisman of somin shorai,and shimekazari(sacred shinto rope with festoons),are actively performed as a prayer for protection from evil in somin-sai festival that takes place in various places including within iwate prefecture in the yasaka-jinja shrine in kyoto and in ise and shima regions as an annual event.
