gimin
gimin is a ringleader of uprising during a famine and the like.
gimin is a person who directly appealed poverty due to heavy pressure of nengu(annual tribute,land tax)to a feudal lord or the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)as a representative for village communities mainly in edo period.
direct appeal deserved capital crime,so it was praised as a heroic deed.
for example,during the ueda riot in 1761 in which about ten thousand peasants belonged to urano-gumi unit(present-day aoki mura,bessho of ueda city,shioda and others in nagano prefecture)of ueda domain(present-day ueda city,nagano prefecture)pushed into the ueda-jo castle,hanbei shimizu and asanojo nakazawa led the uprising and were executed.
sogoro sakura is a well-known gimin who is almost legendized.
