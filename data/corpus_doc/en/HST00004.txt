the reason the 53 stations were established
according to one theory,ieyasu tokugawa set the number of stations from edo(kanji characters with the same sound,穢土,meaning unclean land)to kyo(which means the land where fugen bosatsu(普賢菩薩)lives),based on a chapter from kegon-kyo sutra,in which zenzai-doshi(善財童子)of 'nyuhokkaibon(入法界品),' following the orders of monju bosatsu,achieved enlightenment at the place of fugen bosatsu,through 53 teachers.
the 57 stations of the tokaido road
as an extension of the tokaido road,the stations of the kyokaido road(osaka kaido road)were established in 1619.
in some cases the stations of the kyokaido road are included and are collectively referred to as the 57 stations of the tokaido road.
furthermore,when entering the kyokaido road from the tokaido road,sanjo-ohashi bridge will not be crossed,and the route taken will turn southwest at higechaya-oiwake(髭茶屋追分)(oiwake-cho,otsu city),so the station following otsu-juku station will be fushimi-juku station.
these will be categorized according to their respective provinces.
the first number is based on the country.
the second number is a serial number,starting with shinagawa-juku station.
