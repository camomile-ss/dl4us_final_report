chikkin
chikkin is a koto(a traditional japanese stringed musical instrument)with three strings,which was invented by chikkin(yosaburo)tamura from numazu city,shizuoka prefecture,in august,1886.
tamura taught it in kanda kamakura-cho in tokyo.
summary
the sound box of chikkin was constructed from a thick bamboo stick in the length similar to yagumo-goto(two-stringed zither),which was cut in half lengthwise,with the opening of the u-shaped form covered with paulownia board and strung over with three strings.
koma(bridges)and tenjin(a bar mounted on the head of a stringed instrument to wind up a string around)resemble the one of yagumo-goto.
after setting chikkin on a stand and tuning three strings in the same way as shamisen(a three-stringed japanese banjo),it is played by holding the strings down with suikan(a green pipe)fitted on the middle finger of the left hand and plucking the strings with a diagonally-cut pick called otoritsume fitted on the forefinger of the right hand,in a similar manner to yagumo-goto.
tamura mastered the technique of shingaku(qing-era chinese music)and regarded the worldly music originated in japan as low-grade music,so he invented chikkin in order to change the bad habit.
he wrote many new songs and performed at izumishima-jinja temple in august,1886.
it is also said that he moved to tokyo to receive a patent for his invention,and was honored with command performance for the empress dowager in december 1888 and the empress in april 1889,which made chikkin become popular for a while.
after the sino-japanese war,its popularity rapidly declined.
