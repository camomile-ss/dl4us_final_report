shimenoshin aridoshi
shimenoshin aridoshi(years of birth and death unknown)was a member of the miburoshigumi(mibu masterless warriors group which was the forerunner of the shinsengumi)and the shinsengumi(literally,the newly selected corps,referring to a special police force for the tokugawa regime).
due to his rare family name,shimenoshin is often mistaken for kango aridoshi,but the two persons are totally different.
shimenoshin joined the miburoshigumi in around june or july,1863,as his name appeared in a 'list of signers for official documents submitted to the shogunate' ('bakufu teishutsu josho shomeisha ichiran' in japanese)which was dated july 10,1863.
shimenoshin participated in the coup of august 18(which occurred on september 30,1863.)
however,judging from the fact that shimenoshin's name was not included in a record of the ikedaya incident taking place on july 8,1864,he supposedly escaped before then.
