fujiwara no nakanari
fujiwara no nakanari(774-october 16,810)was a kugyo(court noble)of the early heian period.
his father was fujiwara no tanetsugu.
his mother was the daughter of awata no michimaro.
since his father,tanetsugu,was assassinated,he was given the jo rank(court official rank)of jugoi(junior fifth rank)despite his young age in 785.
since his younger sister,fujiwara no kusuko,was favored by the emperor heijo,he was treated as someone important and gained a strong political power.
however,he was loathed by people due to his slyness and many despotic inclinations.
he made a charge against fujwiara no yoshiko and her son,the imperial prince iyo,despite their innocence in 807.
once the emperor saga took after the emperor heijo in 809,nakanari and kusuko siblings,who feared the loss of political power,moved to heijokyo with the retired emperor and schemed to carry out the choso(a second accession to the imperial throne)of the retired emperor and caused a conflict between the imperial courts located at different locations.
he became the sangi(royal adviser)and came in line with kugyo in 810.
emperor saga took the first move by capturing nakanari and shot him to death in september of the same year.
