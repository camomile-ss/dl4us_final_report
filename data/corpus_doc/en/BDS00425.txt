history
the history of the omuro school of the shingon sect began with the establishment of ninna-ji temple.
this temple developed as the headquarters of the hirosawa school(one of the two schools in the kogi shingon sect),which valued jiso(the practical aspects of esoteric buddhism,including rituals,incantations and prayers).
since nyudo shinno(priestly imperial prince)shoshin(omuro)took the post as its second monzeki(chief priest),over succeeding generations toward the end of the edo period,members of the imperial family took this post as well.
since nyudo shinno kakusho(shikondai-ji omuro),who was its fifth chief priest,was designated as nihon sohomu,or the head of kosho(office of priests),by being awarded an inji(imperial seal)in 1167,it brought under its umbrella many temples of different sects and vehicles,and thus practically led the japanese buddhist society.
at its peak,it reigned over more than 60 tatchu(sub-temples)and branch temples.
however,during the medieval period the temple was entirely destroyed by fire in the onin war and therefore lost its power.
although the ashikaga,oda and toyotomi clans attempted to restore it during and after the sengoku period(period of warring states),it couldn't be fully revived.
however,financially supported by the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)during the edo period,it was fully restored to its current state;the halls and pagodas we see today were built in or around that time.
in the meiji restoration,its thirtieth chief priest,sumihito(ryogenjoin omuro),became a layman by imperial order.
under his new secular name,imperial prince komatsunomiya akihito worked hard to restore the temple by founding an organization called ninnakai in 1883.
since its thirty-first monzeki,it had stopped accepting members of the imperial family as chief priests.
although it temporarily came under the umbrella of to-ji temple("east temple," the grand headquarters of the toji shingon sect,also founded by kukai),it broke away from it in 1900 and officially called itself the omuro school of the shingon sect.
it abandoned its status as a school of the shingon sect;in 1926,it called itself the kogi shingon sect,along with kongobu-ji and daikaku-ji temples.
during world war ii,the japanese government's policy on religion forced kogi(old)and singi(new)shingon sects to be integrated into dai shingon(literally, "large shingon"),but in 1946,after the war it became independent and began referring to itself as the omuro school of the shingon sect.
