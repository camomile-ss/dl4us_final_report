imperial prince koresada
imperial prince koresada(date of birth unknown-august 25,903)was a member of the imperial family during the early heian period.
his father was emperor koko,and his mother was princess hanshi.
his elder brother-uterine was imperial prince koretada,and younger brother-uterine was emperor uda.
on march 23,870 during the era of prince koresada,he was demoted from nobility to subject with his elder brother,prince koretada,and his paternal brothers,and referred to himself as minamoto no koresada.
his position was revised from nisei genji(second generation of the minamoto clan)to issei genji(emperor's son who left the imperial family and had genji name)on may 15,884 soon after his father,emperor koko,ascended the throne,and took up his residence in the sakyoichijo district.
at this time,his younger brother-uterine,prince sadami(emperor uda),and his three younger sisters-uterine were also demoted from nobility to subject.
he became shihon shinno(the fourth-ranked imperial prince)as the second prince of emperor koko because it was decided that a brother-uterine of emperor uda who had already regained his position in the imperial family and ascended the throne in 891 regained the position of imperial family.
thereafter,he served as sakone no chujo(middle captain of the left division)and dazai no sochi(governor-general of the dazai-fu offices),and became sanbon shinno(the third-ranked imperial prince).
before emperor uda compiled "shinsen manyoshu" (anthology of japanese poems),imperial prince koresada selected poems for "koresada shinno-ke utaawase" (poetry contest sponsored by the family of imperial prince koresada)which became the sources of shinsen manyoshu,under a commission from emperor uda.
