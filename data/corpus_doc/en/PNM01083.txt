career
unlike his elder brother-uterine,fujiwara no sanenobu,who lacked competence as a politician,he distinguished himself as a competent politician since he was young.
through his careers as a kurodo no to(head chamberlain)and a chugu daibu(master of the consort's household)serving empress fujiwara no shoshi who was the daughter of fujiwara no michinaga,he gained the deep confidence of michinaga.
backed by the strong recommendation of michinaga,he defeated sanenobu and assumed the position of gon chunagon(a provisional vice-councilor of state)(the legend has it that sanenobu died of indignation after a resentful defeat).
he was a trustworthy assistant of michinaga who supported the reign of emperor ichijo,and was regarded as one of the "four superior court nobles in the court of emperor ichijo" along with fujiwara no kinto,fujiwara no yukinari,and minamoto no toshikata.
he had mastered chinese poetry,roei recitation,kangen music,and was renowned as the greatest cultural figures of the day.
he was also known for his exchanges with sei shonagon and frequently appeared in "makura no soshi" (the pillow book)which depicted his romantic episodes.
