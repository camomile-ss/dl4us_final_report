the origin of this temple was that toshifusa kinoshita(1573-1637),who was the lord of the ashimori domain in the bicchu province and a nephew of kita no mandokoro,legal wife of hideyoshi toyotomi,moved keshoden(dressing hall building)of the fushimi-jo castle into his residence and made it a temple.
the jigo(literally, "temple name"),which is the title given to a buddhist temple,entoku-in was named after toshifusa's hogo(a buddhist name).
