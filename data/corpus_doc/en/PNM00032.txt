yoshikatsu mori
yoshikatsu mori(year of birth not known-july 1,1582)was nobunaga oda's retainer.
common name was shinsuke(also written as "新介" instead of "新助"),and shinzaemon.
he also had name of hidetaka.
his status was nobunaga's umamawari(general's mounted guard),but in another view,he was a kosho(page).
although his birthplace is not known,he served nobunaga oda and he helped kazutada hattori who had been injured in the battle of okehazama in1560 and beheaded yoshimoto imagawa.
as the reward for that,he was later promoted to a member of kurohoroshu(a group of selected warriors of nobunaga oda),but after nobunaga's visit to kyoto,he did not have any remarkable achievements,so that although he made his name in the attack on okochi-jo castile and the invasion of koshu,he was not promoted to a chief of troops but he belonged to the troops of the direct vassal to nobunaga as a close vassal because he worked mainly as a clerical staff.
in 1582,on the occasion of the honno-ji temple incident,he had followed nobunaga to kyoto and had stayed in the nijo-jo castle to guard nobutada oda who was the heir of nobunaga and proved himself as a kurohoroshu and fought bravely and died in battle.
