suijin(the god of water and rain)
suijin(or mizugami)is the generic term for the gods relating to water(mainly fresh water).
suijin in japan
water is of crucial importance in agriculture,and the availability and quality of water can spell life or death to farmers in terms of the volume of harvest.
as a result,suijin naturally came to be associated with tanokami(rice-field gods).
most suijin are found enshrined on the dikes of irrigation canals,or alongside paddy fields.
in some cases,suijin may be found enshrined as mikumari no kami(water distributing god)at the sources of agricultural waterways,in which cases they may also be associated with yamanokami(god of the mountain).
in addition to their connection with the water used in agriculture,suijin are also found enshrined at sources of water used in everyday life,such as household wells and water-drawing spots.
kappa(water imp),snakes,and dragons are among those symbolizing suijin.
they are considered to be divine servants or even to be the embodiment of a deity.
