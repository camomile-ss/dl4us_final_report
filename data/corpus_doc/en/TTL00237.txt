summary
especially in the highest rank of ryoseikoku provinces called taigoku,daijo,meaning higher jo,and shojo,meaning lower jo,were established.
regardless of what chinese characters are used,the letters indicating the third official are read 'jo',which is considered to have come from the chinese reading of '丞' (jo); '丞' was originally the title for the third official in some government offices in tang dynasty.
the letter '掾' is read 'en' in japanese by onyomi,the japanese reading derived from the original chinese pronunciation.
