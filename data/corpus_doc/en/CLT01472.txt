story line
the world is in time of peace,the period of parties in all sizes.

tarokaja comes out to the city and shouts, 'i would like to buy suehiro!' on the main street.
a swindler(vendor)overhears about this and tries to sell old oiled paper umbrella saying 'this is a suehiro.'
tarokaja says, 'it uses a good paper and frames,but there is no picture(絵:reads 'e').'
the swindler replies, 'it is not about picture(絵:reads 'e'),but a handle(柄:also reads 'e').'
tarokaja bustles with joy and buys the umbrella,paying large sum of money.
the swindler feels ill at ease seeing tarokaja being fooled so easily,and calls tarokaja to stop.
i will give you a free gift.'
it will be good to dance when your master is in bad mood.'

the man gets furious seeing what tarokaja brought back,and tarokaja realizes that he was fooled.
tarokaja dances hayashi(hayashi-mono)taught by the swindler.
good mood returns to the man,and he dances with tarokaja.
