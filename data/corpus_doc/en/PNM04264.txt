tsunezane tada
tsunezane tada(date of birth and death unknown)was a samurai in the early kamakura period.
he was the originator of the tada clan of yamato province.
it is believed that he was from tada clan,which was the direct descendant of the settsu-genji(minamoto clan),and was the eighth generation of the decendent of minamoto no mitsunaka(tada no manju)and the son of minamoto no takayori(the name of tsunezane is not confirmed in the family trees including "sonpi bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]).
however he is also said to come from nakamura clan of hirose county,yamato province,and his pedigree record is uncertain.
the tada clan lost the tada-no-sho estate,which was their territory for generations;therefore tsunezane tada moved from his birthplace settsu to tada,uda-gun,yamato province(tada,murou-ku,uda city,nara prefecture)in the kempo era(1213 to 1218)and settled there.
afterwards,descendents of tsunezane continued as powerful local lords(kokujin)in the higashiyama inland of yamato province through out the medieval period.
