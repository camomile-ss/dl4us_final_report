kanei mohan kojou(government-run model factories)
government-run model factories were set up by the meiji government for the promotion of new industries.
after meiji restoration,the government took over bakufu's(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)and feudal clans' businesses such as dockyards and mines,and kobusho(the ministry of industry)and other institutes established government-run factories to modernize japan and make the transition to capitalism.
due to financial difficulties after the seinan war,most factories were sold to private hands after 'general rules for selling government-run factories' came into force in 1880.
these factories promoted the formation of zaibatsu(company syndicate)and became the core of the japanese industries.
