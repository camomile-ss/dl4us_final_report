chaki(tea utensils)
chaki is a general term for containers used in chanoyu(the tea ceremony)to hold green powdered tea.
generally,it can be roughly classified into two categories:the ceramic 'chaire' (tea container),and the wooden 'usuchaki' (tea utensil for light tea)(refer to individual categories).
in the current tea ceremony,it has become customary to use chaire to pour the koicha(thick tea)and usuchaki to pour the usucha(thin tea),but this custom only started in the edo period.
