kaigen-hoyo
kaigen-hoyo is a buddhist memorial service held at the completion of buddhist statue,painting,altar,or tomb.
it is also called kaigen-kuyo,nyukon-shiki,or tamaire.
an exception of jodo shinshu(the true pure land sect of buddhism)will be described later.
summary
when making a buddhist statue, 'tensei,' or inserting the eyes is performed at the end of the process to consecrate a man-made statue.
since the statue is completed by investing it with soul,tensei in particular was regarded as important and later became a ceremony of 'kaigen-hoyo.'
todai-ji temple great buddha
a famous kaigen-hoyo in japan is todai-ji temple great buddha(vairocana)eye-opening ceremony held on may 30,752.
it was held by the emperor shomu and a buddhist priest bodai senna who came to japan from tenjiku(india)via tang(china)inserted the eyes.
at the ceremony,five-color ropes attached to the writing brush to insert the eyes were handed to the people gathered so that they could receive a blessing.
exception:jodo shinshu
jodo shinshu has no concept of investing honzon(principal image of buddha)with soul;instead,they hold a buddhist service for auspicious event called 'goishi' or 'owatamashi' (written as御移徙).
the kanji characters '移徙' (ito)(also called '徙移' [shii])used in 'goishi' means to move or transfer.
when it is called 'watamashi,' it is an honorific expression of transfer of a noble person,referring to the buddha to worship.
