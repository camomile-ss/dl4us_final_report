shijo
shijo refers to an outer citadel,fort or fortification built to protect the main castle and perform a backup role.
it was called an 'edajiro' (branch castle)to distinguish it from 'nejiro' (root castle)which indicates the main castle.
there are many types depending on the role and they also varied in scale.
in the sengoku period(period of warring states)(japan)a diverse network called 'shijo-mo' was created between the main castle and shijo.
