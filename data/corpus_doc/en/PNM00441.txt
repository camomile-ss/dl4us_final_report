sosetsu sen
sosetsu sen,also known as sen no sosetsu(1592 to 1652)was a chajin(master of the tea ceremony).
sosetsu was the first son of sotan sen.
there are many things which are not clear about sosetsu's life.
sosetsu did not get along with his father,sotan and left his home when he was young to live in edo as a masterless warrior.
(according to another view,sosetsu was disowned by sotan.)
there are two views according to one of which sosetsu served the maeda family of kaga clan by mediation of a priest,takuan soho,however,he soon resigned and lived as a retiree,and according to the other sosetsu did not served any clan because he hated the intervention of sotan.
later on,sosetsu returned to kyoto and died in shoden-ji temple where he lodged.
