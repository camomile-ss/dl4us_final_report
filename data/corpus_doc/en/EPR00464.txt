kuwashihime no mikoto
kuwashihime no mikoto was the empress of emperor korei,one of the eight emperors who reigned during the kesshi-hachidai(eight undocumented sovereigns).
she was the real mother of emperor kogen.
in the main text of "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan),she is mentioned as the empress,and she was a daughter of shiki no agatanonushi ome.
in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters),the empress was hosohime,a daughter of ome,who was an ancestor of tochi no agatanonushi.
on the other hand,the first addendum to the nihonshoki mentions the empress was kasuganochichihayayamakahime.
however,the second addendum describes the empress as mashitahime,who was an ancestor of tochi no agatanonushi and others.
