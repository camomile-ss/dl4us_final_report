minbusho-satsu
minbusho-satsu is a bank note issued by the minbusho(ministry of popular affairs)of the meiji government from november 15,1869 to the next year.
it was a complementary bank note to the dajokan-satsu issued by the daijokan(grand council of state).
after the meiji government was established,the 5 kinds(10 ryo,5 ryo,1 ryo,1 bu,1 shu)of dajokan-satsu(kinsatsu,a golden bank note)were issued as an alternative to the currency issued by the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),but only expensive kinsatsu were issued in order to complement public finance,and 1 bu or 1 shu were rarely issued,so they could not accommodate public demand.
that's why a total of 7.5 million ryo consisted of 4 kinds of bank notes,2 bu,1 bu,2 shu and 1 shu were issued by the minbusho.
this is the minbusho-satsu.
minbusho-satsu was used as a complement of dajokan-satsu and for public demand,and 1 ryo of minbusho-satsu could be exchanged for 1 ryo of dajokan-satsu.
however,it was available only for 5 years,until dajokan-satsu would be circulated.
but,counterfeit bills of minbusho-satsu and dajokan-satsu were forged in various places because the foundation of the meiji government was not strengthened enough.
that made the meiji government collect both minbusho-satsu and dajokan-satsu.
exchange for the new bank note(meiji tsuho)issued in 1871 was started,and when the regulation of kinsatsu exchange government securities was issued on march 30,1873,minbusho-satsu and dajokan-satsu were renovated in exchange for the public bond bearing 6%interest a year as a general rule,they were started to be collected properly.
after that,on june 30,1876,okura-sho(ministry of the treasury)notified that acceptance and exchange of minbusho-satsu would be halted,but it took a long time to collect,finally,a deadline was set on september 30,1878,and the acceptance and exchange was halted.
the collection was almost completed including the liquidation by the following year,1879.
