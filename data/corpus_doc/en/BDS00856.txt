otani-byodo mausoleum
the otani-byodo was the mausoleum of shinran who was the founder of jodo shinshu sect
shinran died in 1262,and ten years after the otani-byodo was build.
after that a statue of shinran was placed and it became called otani-eido(eido means a hall of image),but it was destructed later by the infighting of the sect.
in 1321,kakunyo rebuilt the otani-eido and changed it to a temple as the hongan-ji temple.
later in 1602,when the hongan-ji temple was split,the grave was split into the otani honbyo mausoleum(nishi otani)and the otani sobyo mausoleum(higashi otani)until now.
