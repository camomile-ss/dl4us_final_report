kyoto higashiyama hanatoro(path with flowers and lanterns)
kyoto higashiyama hana toro refers to a touristic event to herald the arrival of early spring in the middle of march,that about 2400 lanterns,which are made by kiyomizu ceramics(traditional handicrafts in kyoto),kitayamasugi round cedar wood,kyomei bamboo,stone art and metal art,are lit on the narrow path for about 4.6 km from shoren-in temple to kiyomizu-dera temple at the foot of higashiyama mountain range of kyoto to enjoy an evening walk.
summary
though kyoto at night have been known by some people such as local people and hotel guests,different from the daytime with relatively high number of tourists,a narrow path in and around higashiyama had never been a place to walk except downtown areas,partly because of the limit of opening hours of most temples and shrines.
this event,having started since 2003,is held only for 10 days,but has been well established as an event where you can enjoy the impression and atmosphere of kyoto at night,and attracts more than a million people each year.
higashiyama in the early spring is enveloped by a fantastic atmosphere,briefly attracting people,who walk,while seeing some events and various lanterns illuminating faintly their feet on the path,starting from jingumichi road and shoren-in temple in the north,via chion-in temple,maruyama park,yasaka-jinja shrine and shinkomichi road,viewing daiun-in temple gion-kaku(kyoto),to entoku-in,kodai-ji temple,nene no michi(the path of nene),ichinenzaka slope,ninenzaka slope,and kiyomizu-dera temple.
