hidetane taga
hidetane taga(1565-november,1616)was a busho(japanese military commander)who lived during the sengoku period(period of warring states in japan).
he was the second son to hideshige hori.
he was the younger brother to hidemasa hori.
his title was izumo no kami(governor of izumo province).
he became the adopted son-in-law to sadayoshi taga,the lord of takashima county in omi province;however,he was forfeited his rank and properties in 1582 because he sided with mitsuhide akechi during the incident at honno-ji temple,and consequently he became a vassal of his elder brother hidemasa,and he was given 8,000 koku(1 koku＝5.12 us bushels:8000 koku＝40,960 us bushels of rice crop per year for income from his territory)of feudal estate.
after hidemasa's death,he served under hidenaga toyotomi and then hideyoshi toyotomi;then he took the side of toyotomi clan and took part in the battle of komaki-nagakute(the battle between hideyoshi hashiba(the former name of hideyoshi toyotomi before getting granted the name toyotomi)and ieyasu tokugawa with nobukatsu oda),the siege of odawara(the war between hideyoshi toyotomi and the hojo clan still influential in kanto region based on odawara)and invasion of the korean peninsula(the invasion of korean peninsula promoted by hideyoshi toyotomi).
although he had come to own 20,000 koku(102,400 us bushels of rice per year for income from his territory)at kaguraoka in yamato province,he was once again forfeited his rank and properties because he took the side of the western camp during the battle of sekigahara and participated in the siege of otsu-jo castle.
although hidetane relied on the help and support of his nephew hideharu hori,the hori clan also faced the forfeiture of the rank and property during the reign of tadatoshi hori,forcing hidetane to once again become a ronin(a lord-less samurai).
he belonged and served under the maeda clan during the siege of osaka,and his outstanding service during the battle was recognized;he was taken into the service of toshitsune maeda for 6,000 koku(30,720 us bushels of rice per year income from his territory),yet in november 1616,the next year of the siege of osaka,he passed away.
