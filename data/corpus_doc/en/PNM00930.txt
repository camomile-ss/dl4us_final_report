fujiwara no narito
fujiwara no narito(987-date of death unknown)was a noble in the heian period.
he was a son of fujiwara no moronaga(southern house)of the matanari branch of the southern house of the fujiwara clan.
his sons included fujiwara no nagamune and fujiwara no nagaaki.
after occupying posts such as tonomo no kami(the director of the imperial palace keeper's bureau)and izumo no kami(the governor of izumo province),he left the capital to become the mutsu no kami(the governor of mutsu province)in 1050.
in the following year of 1051,the abe clan(oshu province)tried to expand their region of authority beyond the koromo-gawa river;narito,the mutsu no kami(governor of mutsu province),joined forces with taira no shigenari,akitajo no suke(provincial governor of akita-jo castle in dewa province)and others in an attempt to control them,but suffered a crushing loss in onikiribe and was replaced.
this was the beginning of the "zen kunen no eki" (early nine-years campaign).
the situation at that time was described in a report to the throne as 'people in six districts in the east of kyoto revolted like barbarians,stating that they own the territories and acting against the order of the throne,' by minamoto no yoriyoshi,narito's successor.
