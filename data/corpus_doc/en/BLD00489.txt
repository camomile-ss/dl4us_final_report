summary
according to the record of "todaiji yoroku" (the digest record of todai-ji temple),jitchu,a priest in the nara period,built it.
it is described as 'doto' (earthen tower)there.
on the other hand,there is a tradition that it was genbo's kubi-zuka(burial mound for heads)since "shichidaiji junrei shiki" (private journal of a pilgrimage to the seven great temples)in the heian period.
the sound of 'doto' changed to 'zuto' and with a relation of the theory of genbo's kubi-zuka,chinese character '頭塔' (head tower)is thought to have been applied.
