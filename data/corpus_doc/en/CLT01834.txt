mizore nabe(hot pot served with grated daikon radish)
mizore nabe is a kind of dish cooked in a pot at the table.
it is called so because when cooked,the grated daikon radish becomes translucent,resembling mizore(sleet).
it is also called as "yukinabe" or "awa yukinabe."
it is faster to grate a daikon radish coarsely with a bamboo grater called "onioroshi" instead of using a regular grater,and it also gives good texture.
grated daikon radish is put into an earthenware pot,and is heated with an addition of a small amount of salt.
when it starts to boil,add tofu cut into bite-sized pieces and eat with ponzu(citrus seasoned soy sauce)when heated.
it is believed that when tofu is boiled with grated daikon radish,for some reason,no bubbles form inside the tofu(writer named shotaro ikenami writes that it is good to add chopped radish for the same reason when making boiled tofu).
also,other types of pot dishes such as when grated radish is added to finish up yosenabe(pot of chicken,seafood and vegetables)are called "mizore nabe" as well.
in terms of nutrition,yosenabe has less damage to the vitamins.
further,since the smell is similar to 'takuan zuke' (yellow pickled radish)takes up the whole room when the grated daikon radish is directly heated without any treatment,it is good to first squeeze out moisture,and then exposing it in water to drain out the sulfuric constituent.
since daikon radish contains enzymes that help digestion,you can enjoy mizore nabe even when your stomach is weak after drinking too much alcohol.
