haze
haze is a notion considered to be important in the seigiku process,that is a manufacturing process of sake rice malt,in the brewing process of sake.
it refers to a condition that the hyphae of the sake rice malt have taken root,which looks to be cut into steamed rice.
it also refers in particular to many white spots appeared on the surface of the rice seen by the naked eye of a manufacturer.
this is a sign that aspergillus has been gradually breeding.
it comes to give off the breeding heat as it breeds,and how to diffuse and cool it is a big part of the manufacturing process of the rice malt.
however,the melting progress of the rice changes depending on whether the white spots haze appears only in a part of a rice grain or the whole rice.
the aspect how haze have appeared,' which is therefore to be watched,is called hazekomi conditions.
rice malt is classified and considered as following depending on the hazekomi conditions.
tsukihaze type:when haze appear only at a part of a rice grain.
it makes the flavor of sake light and delicate.
sohaze type:when haze appear the whole rice.
it makes the flavor of sake rich and strong.
it is generally said that tsukihaze type is good for ginjo sake(high-quality sake brewed at low temperatures from rice grains milled to 60%weight or less)and sohaze type for junmai sake(sake in which only ingredients are rice and yeast).
but that can be freely applied depending on the concept of sake breweries.
