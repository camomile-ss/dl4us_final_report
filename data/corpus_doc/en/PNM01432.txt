by the way,the following story is described in "kanmongyoki" (1416-1448,the diary of zuiko-in)but it is not known whether the descriptions were true or not:the kazainin family line became extinct,because tadasada kazanin had no heir,and therefore,he secretly took custody of 'a son of konoe in the southern court' (a descendant of tsunetada konoe,kanpaku in the southern court-in japan),who later celebrated his coming of age,with a crown put on his head by yoshimochi ashikaga,seii taishogun(literally,the great general whose mission was to subdue the barbarians)and was granted a portion of tadasada's name.
