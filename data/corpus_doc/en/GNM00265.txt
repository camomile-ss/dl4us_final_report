otsu city
otsu city is a city located at the southwest end of shiga prefecture,which is the prefectural capital.
it is designated as a core city.
summary
it is an ancient capital known since emperor tenchi transferred the capital to omi no miya(omi palace),and it is dotted with lots of historical sites including shrines and temples such as enryaku-ji temple on mt.hiei as the world cultural heritage,onjo-ji temple(mii-dera temple)and hiyoshi-taisha shrine.
centered around otsu-juku,which is an important port of lake biwa and used to be the 53rd posting station of tokai-do road,it consists of zeze,the castle town of the zeze domain,sakamoto,a temple town of mt.hiei,and katata,a hub of lake-borne trade.
although it is the prefectural capital,the feature as a core city of shiga prefecture is weak since it is located at the southwest end of the prefecture and adjacent to kyoto city,and it has been developed as a satellite city of kyoto.
geography
location
