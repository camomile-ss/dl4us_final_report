marquis
they were within the fujiwara no morozane line of the northern house of the fujiwara clan.
it was founded during the last days of the heian period by fujiwara no tsunezane(1068-1131),who was a son of fujiwara no morozane,sessho kanpaku(regent and chief adviser to the emperor),as the founder.
as his mansion was located in oinomikado-kita(north of oinomikado)and madenokoji-higashi(east of madenokoji),he named himself oinomikado.
tsunezane's highest rank was dainagon(chief councillor of state).
however,his son,fujiwara no tsunemune(1119-1189),on the occasion of the heiji war,contributed to the victory of the taira no kiyomori side by first joining the fujiwara no nobuyori/minamoto no yoshitomo side at first and then changing sides.
also,he wielded great power as the maternal father of emperor nijo and he was promoted to sadaijin(minister of the left)and secured kakaku of seigake.
tsunemune's son,fujiwara no yorizane(1155-1225)took the position of daijo-daijin(grand minister)twice.
after the meiji restoration,the position of marquis was conferred on this family during the generation of ikumaro oinomikado.
