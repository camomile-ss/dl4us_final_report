fujiwara no mitsuko
fujiwara no mitsuko(781-october 21,828)was a noblewoman and court lady during the early heian period.
she was from the southern house of the fujiwara clan.
her father was fujiwara no matanari.
mitsuko's paternal grandfather was fujiwara no kosemaro who was executed during fujiwara no nakamaro's war.
her husband was fujiwara no fuyutsugu.
born of an impoverished aristocrat family,it is suspected that mitsuko had an unhappy childhood,but it is considered that,in addition to becoming the wife of fujiwara no fuyutsugu with whom she had three sons and a daughter,she contributed to political maneuvers of fuyutsugu by using the connection of her own relatives.
on may 25,814,when emperor saga visited the kanindai residence of fuyutsugu and mitsuko,a common citizen,was appointed as jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)("ruiju kokushi" (classified national history)).
mitsuko later became naishi no tsukasa(female palace attendant)naishi no kami(principal handmaid,as documented in "nihon sandai jitsuroku" (the sixth of the six classical japanese history texts)on november 19,871 and "the emperor buntoku jitsuroku" on august 31,850),serving the two emperors including emperor saga and emperor junna("sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy)and "ichidai yoki" (summary chronicle of each reign))and dominating kokyu(empress's residence).
although fuyutsugu was popular among ladies,it seems that he and mitsuko were happily married and,when she died mitsuko was buried together with her husband in fuyutsugu's tomb in accordance with her will.
mitsuko was conferred juichii(junior first rank)later on.
