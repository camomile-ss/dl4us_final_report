bukkoji-dori street
the bukkoji-dori street is a street running east-west in kyoto city,kyoto prefecture.
it corresponds to the gojo-bomon-koji street in heiankyo.
it runs from the right bank of the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa water system)in the east to the sainishi-dori street in the west between the ayanokoji-dori street and the takatsuji-dori street.
a small scale shopping district constitutes the section between higashi-shinmichi street and nakamachi-dori street.
its name originates from the fact that it faced the north edge of bukko-ji temple after the relocation of the temple(1586).
until modern times some called the takatsuji-dori street bukkoji-dori street,while the current bukkoji-dori street was called gojo-bomon-dori street--its former name..
