the first line is supposed to include the word 'toki' (meaning 'it is')also implied mitsuhide's surname,and 'ame ga shita' also meant 'tenka' (the whole country),to show his long-held wish of killing his master nobunaga oda for which joha demanded an explanation later.
it is said that 'ame ga shita-shiru' (to have the meaning 'coming into power' as well)in the first line was changed from 'ame ga shita-naru.'
this verse is contained in zoku-gunsho ruiju(the library of historical documents,continued).
