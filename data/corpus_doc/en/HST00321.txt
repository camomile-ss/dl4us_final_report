togu-no-fu(an official in charge of education of the crown prince)
togu-no-fu was a kind of educational officer that worked for the togu(crown prince)as stipulated in the ritsuryo system(a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code).
togu-no-fu was a standing official that taught the crown prince morality and gave him guidance.
only one person at a time could become togu-no-fu,and togu-no-fu was often an aristocrat with an official court rank of jushiijo(junior fourth rank,upper grade).
this togu-no-fu position was modeled after taishisanshi of the tang dynasty.
togu-no-fu was the grand minister at togu's palace and was independent of togubo(crown prince's quarters)members,who were in charge of the domestic economy of the palace,or togu gakushi(crown prince's classics teacher);therefore,he did not have any delegation authority.
just as was the case with togu gakushi,togu-no-fu also did not have any subordinates or upper organization;therefore,shikibu-sho(ministry of the ceremonial)assessed the service level of togu-no-fu.
from the middle of the heian period,togu gakushi and togu-no-fu were collectively called togu-shiki(the board of the crown prince's affairs)as contrasted to togubo.
togu-no-fu was also called kotaishi-fu(an official in charge of education of the crown prince).
