minamoto no tamenari
minamoto no tamenari(?-august 24,1156)was a military commander of the kawachi-genji branch of the minamoto clan who lived at the end of the heian period.
he was the seventh son of minamoto no tameyoshi.
his mother was a daughter of narimune kamo who was a shinto priest of the kamo-jinja shrine.
his other names were shichiro hachiman and shichiro kamo.
in the hogen disturbance,he followed tameyoshi's lead and joined the battle taking the side of the retired emperor sutoku and fujiwara no yorinaga.
his force however was defeated and he and his father surrendered to his older brother minamoto no yoshitomo.
although yoshitomo begged for their lives,yoshitomo himself ended up having to kill tamenari,his father,and his brothers in the funaokayama district in kita ward,kyoto city.
there is a legend that tamenari kept himself hidden in tenun-zan mountain in kasai city,hyogo prefecture,after the disturbance.
