giku
giku(date of birth and death unknown)was a zen-sect priest from tang china in the early heian period.
he learned under海昌院斉安国師in hang zhou,china.
when empress dowager tachibana no kachiko invited a zen sect priest from tang china by sending egaku as the messenger in 835,giku came to japan due to斉安's recommendation.
at first giku lived in to-ji saiin(the western part of to-ji temple)and then moved to danrin-ji temple,which was established by kachiko,becoming the founder of the temple.
it is said that a lot of people visited him for buddhism,but the zen sect itself didn't become popular and giku returned to tang after a few years.
it is said that when egaku revisited tang china,he engraved giku's accomplishments on a monument,sent it to japan,and built it beside rajomon gate in kyoto.
