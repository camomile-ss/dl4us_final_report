the incident of honkoku-ji temple
the incident of honkoku-ji temple,on january 31,1569,was an attack of miyoshi sanninshu(three chief retainers of the miyoshi clan)on yoshiaki ashikaga,seii taishogun(literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians")of the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),who was in his temporary residence(rokujo palace)in kyoto honkoku-ji temple(it was called 'honkoku-ji' then).
it is also called the battle of rokujo.
yoshiaki ashikaga,who assumed the title of shogun in september of the previous year after going up to the capital while being backed by nobunaga oda,made honkoku-ji temple as his temprorary residence instead of gosho(the imperial palace)because it had been burnt down in the eiroku incident.
nobunaga,after assuring the peace in kyoto,returned once to his base gifu-jo castle in mino province.
however,miyoshi sanninshu,who were in exile in settsu province expelled by nobunaga from kyoto earlier,with the aim of gaining power in kyoto again,attacked honkoku-ji temple while nobunaga was absent from kyoto,and when the guards of yoshiaki let their guard down during the new year.
however against all odds,because yoshiaki's close aids yusai hosokawa and mitsuhide akechi fought a good fight,and katsumasa ikeda and yoshitsugu miyoshi arrived to rescue them the next day,miyoshi sanninshu took escaped the pincer movement.
nobunaga hurriedly returned to kyoto after five days,and thought that merchants of sakai were pulling strings behind the scene before imposing yasen(war funds)on sakai to restrict their autonomy.
