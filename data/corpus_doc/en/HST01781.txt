joshu daimyo(governors of castles)
joshu daimyo(daimyo who is allowed to live in a castle)is a social status in the early-modern times of the edo period,and refers to a daimyo,who was allowed to have a castle as his residence in his kunimoto(hometown),among daimyo families(feudal lord families)classified according to their resident provinces and resident castles into five ranks:kokushu(landed daimyos),jun(associate)kokushu,joshu(lord of a castle),joshukaku(joshu class),mujo(without a castle)(jinya[regional government office]).
in addition,for controlling daimyos there were a list of daimyos containing nami-daimyo(low-class daimyos)appointed to shodaifu(jugoinoge[junior fifth rank,lower grade])and another list of those who could be promoted to shihon(the fourth-rank)or higher;and they were distinguished by the rooms where they were assigned to wait before being received in audience.
in 1867,there were 151 daimyo families.
according to "buke shohatto" (code for the warrior households)issued in 1717,a joshu could repair building parts equal to or less than a tower,fence or gate after submitting an application and obtaining an approval;and,when a stone wall was broken,the joshu was supposed to report to bugyo(commissioner[in charge of repair and management])and to receive his instruction.
for this reason it was said that the shiro(castle)under the tokugawa shogunate system was defined as a structure including fences and a tower on a stone wall.

joshukaku daimyo(daimyo without castle,but treated almost as joshu daimyo)
a joshukaku daimyo was a daimyo whose residence in his hometown was a jinya,but who was treated like a joshu daimyo;which is an example of preferential treatment of a daimyo without a castle as joshu daimyo.
the minimum karoku(hereditary stipend)of roju(member of shogun's council of elders)was 25,000 koku(1 kokuÔºùapproximately 180.39 liters)rice crop yields,and,if a daimyo whose position was close to roju,but was receiving less,he was treated as rojukaku;likewise a mujo daimyo(a daimyo without a castle)was treated as joshukaku daimyo.
in the hierarchy of wakadoshiyori(assistants to roju in the edo bakufu),a joshu daimyo,even if nominated later,was placed higher than a mujo nominated earlier.
a legitimate child of a mujo daimyo was not nominated to a shodaibu(low rank official)at jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and was not allowed to ride a vehicle(kago[palaquin]).
a joshukaku daimyo was not allowed to convert his jinya to a castle,actually allowed to build only a castle gate.
however,those who were shihon(the fourth rank)jushiinoge[junior fourth rank,lower grade])were ranked by government posts and appointment years regardless of possession of a castle.
in the seating hierarchy within edo-jo castle,any shodaibu of junior fifth rank,lower grade whose kokudaka(the assessed value of their landholdings in rice),rounded down to the nearest 10,000 koku,was equal to that of a joshu(castle lord)daimyo,was seated one notch down from such joshu daimyo(for example,the todo family,a joshukaku with 53,000 koku,was seated one notch below the mizoguchi family,a joshu with 50,000 koku).
after castles other than main castles were abandoned by ikkoku ichijo rei(law of one castle per province)in1615,many daimyos who were newly promoted or who had their domains subdivided appeared,causing the lack of the sites to be given for building castles.
for this reason,families who had served as wakadoshiyori for many years,and old and noble families were treated as joshukaku,and at the end of edo period there were 19 such families at the end of edo period(1867).
