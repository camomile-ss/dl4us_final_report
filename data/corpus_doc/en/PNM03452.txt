however,when yoshitoki hojo died suddenly,he and his younger sister plotted to remove yoritsune kujo and to place sanemasa ichijo as a shogun and his nephew,masamura hojo,as a regent,respectively.
although he also sought support from yoshimura miura,who was masamura's eboshi-oya(a person who puts an eboshi(formal headwear for court nobles)on a young man's head on his genpuku(attainment of manhood)ceremony),the plot failed in their attempt,and he was exiled to shinano province(incident of the iga clan).

in 1244,he assumed the post of hyojoshu(a member of the council of state).
on february 17,1257,he died.
