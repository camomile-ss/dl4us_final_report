tadatomo aoyama
tadatomo aoyama was a daimyo(japanese feudal lord)of the edo period and was osaka jodai(the keeper of osaka-jo castle).
he was the third lord of the tanba-kameyama domain and later,the first load of tanba-shinoyama domain.
he was the seventh head of the aoyama clan.
he was the second son of yoshimasa aoyama who was the lord of the tango-miyazu domain.
since toshiharu aoyama,the lord of the tanba-kameyama domain died without an heir,tadatomo was adopted as his successor from a branch family which governed the tango-miyazu domain.
however,since tadatomo himself did not have a child heir either,he adopted tadataka aoyama,a son of his elder brother,to succeed to him.
