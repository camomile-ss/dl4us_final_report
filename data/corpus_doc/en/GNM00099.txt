kyoto basin
kyoto basin is the name of the basin which is situated in kyoto prefecture.
the northern edge of kyoto basin almost coincides with the northern boundaries of kita ward and sakyo ward(both in kyoto city),and its eastern edge almost coincides with the eastern boundaries of higashiyama ward,fushimi ward(both in kyoto city)and uji city,while its western edge almost coincides with the west boundaries of nishikyo ward in kyoto city,nagaokakyo city and oyamazaki-cho.
its southern edge almost coincides with the southern boundary of kizugawa city,which is next to the heijo hills.
it is a vast basin which roughly includes the central and southern part of former yamashiro province.
the basin was formed by active faults,including those in the mitoke fault zone,nishiyama fault zone and arima-takatsuki tectonic line,and in addition,hanaori fault.
katsura-gawa river(the yodo-gawa river system)flows into kyoto basin from tanba plateau,kamo-gawa river(the yodo-gawa river system)flows from kitayama,uji-gawa river flows from lake biwa in shiga prefecture,and kizu-gawa river(kyoto prefecture)flows from nabari city,mie prefecture.
these tributaries join near the goko-bashi bridge in yawata city,resulting in the single mainstream known as yodo-gawa river which flows into osaka bay.
incidentally,this place is well-known to local residents as an area where the three rivers join together.
