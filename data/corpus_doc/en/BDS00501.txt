history
once there was a temple of the tendai sect,called jodo-ji temple,but that site is now occupied by jisho-ji temple(ginkaku-ji temple).
though nothing is clear in detail about this jodo-ji temple,including the year of its establishment,it is known that fujiwara no gyoshi,the spouse of imperial prince ariakira,the son of emperor godaigo,entered the priesthood in this jodo-ji temple in 986,and that myogu,the son of imperial prince ariakira,also entered this temple as a priest.
since then it had maintained a close relationship with the imperial family,but it was forced to move to the vicinity of sokoku-ji temple when the eighth shogun of the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),yoshimasa ashikaga,constructed his mountain villa,which was later called jisho-ji ginkaku temple,on the same site of jodo-ji temple,and subsequently jodo-ji temple was abolished.
in the wake of the abolished jodo-ji temple,the current jodo-in temple was built during the period from 1716 to 1736.
