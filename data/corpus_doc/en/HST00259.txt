tenryaku no chi
tenryaku no chi describes the idealized political reign of the emperor murakami in mid-heian period(in the mid-10th century).
tenryaku was the era name of the emperor murakami.
although he had placed fujiwara no tadahira as kanpaku(chief adviser to the emperor)for a while since his accession in 946,he did not appoint any sekkan(regents and advisers)but took power by himself after tadahira's death in 949.
later,emperor murakami's reign was highly regarded as the ideal of imperial governance and was called engi,tenryaku no chi(glorious engi and tenryaku rules)together with another ideal imperial governance taken by the emperor daigo(called engi no chi)in the early 10th century.
however,the person who led the governance after tadahira was the head of daijokan(department of state)and also sadaijin(minister of the left)fujiwara no saneyori,and it is thought to have been conscious propaganda to admire murakami's reign as the ideal of imperial governance by the middle-and lower-ranked literary nobility in and after 11th century.
