nikka-mon(or jikka mon)gate
nikka-mon(or jikka mon)gate was one of the naikaku-mon gates that comprised the dairi(imperial palace)and was located on the east side of the south garden of the shishinden hall(throne hall).
the nikka-mon gate that stands in the present kyoto imperial palace was rebuilt according to the ancient design.
summary
located between giyoden hall(treasure hall)and shunkyoden hall,the gate faced gekka-mon gate on the west side of the south garden in an east-west direction.
it was also called "higashi no chu-mon" (lit.eastern inner gate)and "sakonfu no jin" (lit.post of the inner palace guards)because it was assigned to serve as a post for the konoefu(inner palace guards).
during the sekkan period(period of regents and advisors),the court council(jin no sadame;ancient cabinet council)chaired by regents and advisors was frequently held in the sakone(left division of inner palace guards)court in the roofed corridor that led from the shishinden hall to the giyoden hall.
because of this,nikka-mon gate was considered to be more important than gekka-mon gate due to its close proximity to the sakone court.
