hikohitooe no mikoto
hikohitooe no mikoto or oeo was a member of the imperial family who lived during the kofun period(tumulus period).
he was the imperial prince of emperor keiko and his mother was inabi no wakairatsume.
he had a younger brother named mawakao.
in kojiki(the records of ancient matters),he was considered as kagurohime,but since kagurohime was a great-granddaughter of his real older brother,yamato takeru no mikoto,this was biologically impossible(it is actually described in nihonshoki[the oldest chronicles of japan]that she became the empress to emperor ojin,and his name is repeated in kojiki,too).
he took shirogane no miko,his younger paternal half-sister,to his wife,and had children such as onakatsuhime(she became a consort to his nephew,emperor chuai).
