tomomitsu iwakura
tomomitsu iwakura(1810-1813)was a retainer of imperial court during the latter edo period.
his court rank was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade).
his father was a kugyo(top court official)tomoai iwakura.
his mother was the daughter of a kugyo,toshisuke ayanokoji.
he had tomokata iwakura and tomoyoshi iwakura as his younger brother-in-law(even though both of them were older than tomomitsu).
he was the legitimate son of the iwakura family,but died at an early age.
because of that,tomokata was adopted from the imaki family as a child of tomomitsu,but tomokata also died at an early age.
finally,tomoyoshi was adopted from the ohara family as a child of tomokata,and he inherited the iwakura family.
the adopted child of tomoyoshi was the meritorious vassal of the meiji restoration,tomomi iwakura.
