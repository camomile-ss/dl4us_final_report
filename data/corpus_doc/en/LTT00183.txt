nashitsubo no gonin(five gentlemen of the pear chamber)
the "nashitsubo no gonin" represents the key members at the waka-dokoro(the imperial bureau of poetry)established by order of emperor murakami in 951 within the shoyosha,which was one of the shichiden-gosha(seven residences and five houses for the empress and other concubines)inside the heian imperial palace.
the bureau was called nashitsubo(which literally means "palace of the pear")because of the pear trees that grew in the garden of the shoyosha.
it was their responsibility to decipher the oldest anthology of japanese poetry called "the manyoshu"(collection of ten thousand leaves)and the compilation of "the gosen wakashu" (later selected collection of japanese poetry).
the nashitsubo no gonin consisted of the following five members.
onakatomi no yoshinobu
minamoto no shitago
kiyohara no motosuke
sakanoue no mochiki
ki no tokibumi
