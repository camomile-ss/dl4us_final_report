kani
kani(1062-july 12,1101)was a buddhist monk of shingon sect in the late heian period.
his father was imperial prince atsusada,a son of imperial prince koichijoin atsuakira.
he was also called kannonin sozu(a title of high-ranking priest)or miya sozu.
he learned the doctrine of hirosawa school of shingon sect under priest-imperial prince shoshin and became gojiso(a priest who prays for the emperor)of the emperor shirakawa.
in response to the request by priest-imperial prince shoshin,he founded kanjo-in temple at mt.koya in 1086 and was appointed as gon shosozu(a title of high-ranking priest)and betto(a chief administrator of a temple)of enshu-ji temple.
when the retired emperor shirakawa visited mt.koya in 1088,he opened the door of miei-do hall(a hall dedicated to the sect's founder)at the behest of the retired emperor.
as his kujaku kyobo(the ritual for averting disasters)was known as the one that had a miraculous effect,he was appointed as gon daisozu and the second head priest of to-ji temple.
in 1092,he entered into a secluded life at mt.koya ojoin-dani valley and reconstructed henjoko-in temple.
as he hated hirosawa school which was then ornate,he strived to restore it and was deemed as the founder of kannonin school.
