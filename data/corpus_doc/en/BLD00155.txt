summary of the view
when viewed from kasamatsu-koen park,amanohashidate looks like 'naname ichimonji' (a slanting chinese character of 'ä¸€' (ichi,literally,one)).
here,it is possible to enjoy famous matanozoki viewing(to view amanohashidate from between your two legs).
viewed in the matanozoki way,the sky and the earth look upside down,making amanohashidate look just like a bridge across the sky.
this park is located on a mountain.
however,when the mountain is climbed further for three minutes,there is the birth place of "matanozoki" where a pine named 'kasamatsu' (literally,an umbrella pine)stands.
buses for nariai-ji temple,the 28th temple of the 33 temples of kansai kannon pilgrimage,depart from here as well.
