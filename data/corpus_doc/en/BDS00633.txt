the seven patriarchs
the seven patriarchs are the seven high priests selected by shinran,the founder of jodo shinshu(the true pure land sect of buddhism).
they are listed in eshakudan(chapters of teachings of the patriarchs)of 'shoshin nenbutsuge' (the hymn of true faith).
standards of selection
the aspirant of rebirth in the pure land
the person should live and chant nenbutsu(buddhist invocation)by oneself while believing in the original vow of amida buddha(amitabha tathagata).
the list excluded those who tried to reach the buddhist paradise by implementing religious austerities and nenbutsu chanting that put an emphasis on self-salvation.
contribution to the clarification of the original vow's meaning
the person should contribute to the clarification of the original vow's meaning not with the mere observance of his predecessors' teachings but through the development of his own teachings(the development is called hakki).
the suitability of teachings to the original vow
the teachings should match the purpose of the original vow of amida buddha.
whether a book was written
the person should write a book and hand down his teachings to future generations.
the writings of the seven high priests are generally called 'shichiso shogyo' (the sacred teachings of the seven patriarchs).
