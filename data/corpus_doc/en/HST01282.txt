tsuka-gashira(pommel)
"tsuka-gashira" is the equipment attached to a sword.
it is also known as hato.
tsuka-gashira is the equipment of a sword which is attached to the edge of a hilt.
it is the metal part located opposite side of a sword head.
in the kofun period(tumulus period),it was made of gold or silver and used for the exterior of kazari-tachi(decorated sword)for the guard.
specifically,kazari-tachi is classified in kanto-tachi(ring-headed sword)and ento-tachi(round-headed sword)due to the form of tsuka-gashira.
regarding japanese swords,there are two types of tsuka-gashira:round head and cylindrical-shaped head,and some of them have a pattern.
it depends of the sword which type of tsuka-gashira it has,and there are many cases it has no pattern.
by covering the knot of tsuka-ito(the cord wrapping on a sword hilt),tsuka-gashira prevents the knot from coming untied and helps to hide the visually not appealing knot.
together with fuchi-gane(the other end of a hilt),it has an effect to connect the hilt which originally consists of two parts.
unlike fuchi-gane,tsuka-gashira cannot be removed by pulling mekugi(peg)and taking a sword apart.
it can remove only by undoing the tsuka-ito or cut it.
