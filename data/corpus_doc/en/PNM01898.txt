taneyasu togashi
taneyasu togashi(1474?-1535)was the 16th family head of togashi clan(number of generations since takaie togashi).
he was the son of yasunari togashi.
his pseudonym was jiro
as his father,yasunari togashi,died young,he succeeded to the family head after his grandfather,yasutaka togashi.
he changed his name to taneyasu from tsuneyasu,when he was granted to use a portion(in this case 'tane' written in chinese character稙)of the real name of yoshitane ashikaga,the 10th seii taishogun(literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians")of muromachi bakufu(japanese government headed by a shogun).
in 1531,as he supported the sho-ikki side(a moderate uprising group formed by three temples in kaga province)during the kyoroku disturbance,he was expelled from the post of the constable of kaga province),when sho-ikki side lost in the disturbance.
since then,the authority of the provincial constable family,togashi family,had fallen down completely,and instead,hongan-ji temple established the position of mediator exclusively in the entire province.
his son harusada togashi succeeded to the family.
posthumous buddhist name:taiunji dentsuan(泰雲寺殿通安).
