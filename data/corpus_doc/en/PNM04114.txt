shigesada saji
shigesada saji(1174-?)was a samurai who lived during the kamakura period.
he was a son of michisada saji.
yasusada hiketa was his older brother.
he was commonly known as shiro.
he served as goji(a local government official under the ritsuryo system)and jito(manager and lord of manor)of saji-go.
career
he was born to michisada saji in 1174.
his childhood name was刀寿丸.
although his father transferred saji-go to him,he was too young to assume the position of goshi shiki(subdistrict headships)at that time.
therefore,his older brother yasusada hiketa served the position for him.
afterward,shigesada,who had become a gokenin(shogunal retainers)of the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)after reaching the manhood,asked his older brother to return the position of goshi shiki.
however,so far from returning the position to shigesada,his brother yasusada transferred it to his son.
therefore,shigesada sued his older brother.
in may 1213,shigesada performed great feats in the battle of wada at the age of 40 by taking sides with yoshitoki hojo,with the result that he was finally appointed to the position of goji and jito of saji-go in november of the same year.
since then,the descendants of shigesada ruled saji-go for more than a century.
