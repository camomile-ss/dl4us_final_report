teizo wado
teizo wado(year of birth and death unknown)was a member of shinsengumi(special police who guarded kyoto during the end of tokugawa shogunate).
he was a former feudal retainer of the saijo domain in iyo province(saijo town,nii county).
the alternative spelling of his first name is '貞三' (instead of貞造).
it is possible that the pronunciation of his surname may be 'rindo.'
he joined the shinsengumi through the membership recruitment notice that was distributed in the keihan area by december 1864.
in the ensuing appointment,he as well as susumu yamazaki and kisaburo kawai joined the rear-echelon support troop led by sanosuke harada.
in "the eimeiroku" (a list of name of shinsengumi members),which was compiled by sakigake shimada around august 1865,the name of teizo name is flanked by those of shiro kusakabe and shigezo yagane.
it seems that he quitted the shinsengumi soon after the compilation of this list;it is confirmed that he left the special police by october 1865.
in fact,when harumichi yano(a scholar),who had been captured by kanryusai takeda(a member of shinsengumi)in july 4,1865,was released on july 8 and put under house arrest in kyukogo,his boarding house,wado visited kanryusai to keep tabs on him.
yano's diary reads that teizo raised an objection to yano's house arrest.
from this,it can be assumed that teizo left the shinsengumi at that time.
his life after this period is unknown.
