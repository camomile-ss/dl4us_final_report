shishigatani-dori street
shishigatani-dori street is a street running north-south in kyoto city.
it runs from imadegawa-dori street which is near ginkaku-ji temple to the north,to nanzen-ji temple yamauchi in the south,and goes through the mountain in the northern part of higashiyama(kyoto prefecture).
in front of ginkaku-ji temple is a tourist spot,and mansions with big gardens line nanzen-ji temple,but on the way,there is a mountain-foot residential area.
there are substantial traffic jams here caused by the many taxis and tourist buses for worshipers around nanzen-ji temple and zenrin-ji temple(kyoto city)which is similar to shirakawa-dori street to the east.
