aijiro sasaki
aijiro sasaki(1845-september 14,1863)born in osaka city(of former settsu province)was a member of the shinsengumi(a special force that guarded kyoto during the tokugawa shogunate)in its early phase.
career and end
he joined the shinsengumi around june,1863.
he was assassinated by someone and his body with an evidence that he died by violence was found on september 14,1863(according to another theory,on september 22).
there are two different theories regarding aijiro's death.
one theory says that he had an conflict with kamo serizawa who ordered aijiro to hand over his lover,aguri,as kamo's mistress.
since serizawa's subordinate,matasaburo saeki advised aijiro to run off together with her,he withdrew the shinsengumi and tried to leave kyoto with aguri.
however,it was a trap made by saeki and serizawa,and when aijiro was to walk through the shrubs in suzaku,he was brutally murdered by saeki who was ambushing.
his lover,aguri was assaulted by saeki,and she killed herself by biting off her tongue.
another theory says that aijiro sasaki was originally a spy of choshu clan,but he,who was strongly impressed by the shinsengumi's ideal,betrayed the choshu side.
his betrayal was discovered by the choshu side and he was assassinated.
however,the real truth of the incident is unknown,and there are only a few materials.
oral tradition
he was reputedly the most beautiful swordsman in the shinsengumi.
