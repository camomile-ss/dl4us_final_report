national bank(meiji period)
the national bank(kokuritsu ginko)is a financial institution which was established based on the national bank act issued in 1872.
summary
the system was established under hirobumi ito who was okura no shofu(junior assistant minister of the ministry of the treasury)at that time.
kokuritsu ginko' was literal translation of the national bank in the united states(now it is often translated as kokuho ginko),however,it was established not by the nation but by the private capitals from eichi shibusawa,mitsui gumi,and so on.
the national bank had the right to issue the convertible currency,which had the obligation to replace with gold coins,and at first,four banks from the first to the fifth national banks were established.
<ref>the third one was not opened due to the conflict of opinion among founders and it was a vacant number at that time.
when the issue of inconvertible paper currency was permitted in 1876,the national banks increased sharply,and 153 national banks were established until 1879(no charter was approved after that).
the banks identified themselves by the number of established order,therefore,they are also called as "number banks."
some number banks still exist,but only the existing hachijuni bank(82 bank)was established by the merger of the daijuku(19th)bank and the rokujusan(63)bank and named by the total sum of numbers of both banks(82＝19+63).
when the bank of japan was established in 1882,national banks were privatized to be ordinary banks and only the bank of japan has issued the banknotes since then(banknotes issued by the former national banks were in circulation for a while).
remarks
currently,many of the surviving banks which used to be the national banks but did not take over the numbers at the time were established as new legal entities by the integration in wartime according to the principle of one bank per one prefecture under the government measures of 1930 to early 1940.
therefore,the dates of establishment of many current banks,which are the successors to the national banks,are around that period,and the dates of establishment of the national banks are often regarded as 'the dates of foundation.'
(for example,the current akita bank regards the date of establishment of the 48th national bank in january 1879 as 'the date of foundation' and october 20,1941,when the bank became the current akita bank according to the integration in wartime as 'the date of establishment.'
further,the bank named 'akita bank' (1896-1941)existed separately from the daishijuhachi bank(the successor to the 48th national bank)before this establishment.
as described in the following articles,according to the integration of the daishijuhachi bank and the former akita bank in wartime,the current akita bank was established.)
