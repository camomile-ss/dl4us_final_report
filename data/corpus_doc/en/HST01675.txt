shuki-daiban(vermilion-lacquered household goods that were the fujiwara clan's treasures)
shuki-daiban are vermilion-lacquered household goods succeeded as the fujiwara clan's treasures by successive toshi choja(head of the fujiwara clan).
they were used at new year's banquet held by ministers(the fujiwara clan in this case).
it is noted from several records that shuki(vermilion-lacquered dishes and drinking vessels)for grand banquets were stored in four nagabitsu(long wooden box with a lid)and there were 27 daiban(low and rectangular table on which food was served,used by nobles in the heian period)to place shuki,including five large daiban.
according to the tradition,they were contributed to kangakuin(educational institution)by fujiwara no fuyutsugu and possessed by successive toshi choja who doubled as betto(chief officer)of kangakuin for generations.
but their first confirmed appearance in written records is after the time of fujiwara no kaneie and the first transfer of shuki-daiban('shuki watari no gi' [ceremony for the transfer of shuki])to be held on the occasion of the change of toshi choja at higashi sanjo-dono palace did not take place until the time of fujiwara no morozane.
there is a well-known historical event that,when fujiwara no tadazane disowned his eldest son fujiwara no tadamichi,who was kanpaku(chief adviser to the emperor)in 1150 and designated his second son fujiwara no yorinaga as toshi choja,tadazane ordered samurai to transfer shuki-daiban to yorinaga by force.
but grand banquets ceased to be held due to the decline of court functions,and in addition,shuki-daiban seem to have been scattered and lost due to successive conflicts and changes of toshi choja within a short period of time caused by the formation of gosekke(five top fujiwara families whose members were eligible for the positions of sessho[regent]and kanpaku),and when michitsugu konoe assumed the post of toshi choja in 1361, 'shuki watari no gi' no longer took place,which suggests that shuki-daiban had already been lost before that time.
