fujiwara no akitsuna
fujiwara no akitsuna(1029-august 8,1103)was a retainer of imperial court and poet who lived in the latter half of the heian period.
he was in the fujiwara no michitsuna line of the northern house of the fujiwara clan and was the third son of fujiwara no kanetsune,sangi(councilor).
he was ranked shoshiinoge(senior fourth rank,lower grade),and assumed the posts of tanba no kuni no kami(the governor of tanba province),sanuki no kuni no kami(the governor of sanuki province),and tajima no kuni no kami(the governor of tajima province).
he was commonly called sanuki no nyudo(literally,a priest in sanuki).
known as a poet,he participated and wrote waka poems in an utaawase held in the imperial palace in 1078.
"sanuki no nyudo shu" ("akitsuna ason shu")is a collection of his waka poems,and 25 of his waka poems are included in "goshui wakashu" (later collection of gleanings of japanese poetry)and later chokusen wakashu(anthologies of japanese poetry compiled by imperial command).
he was also well versed in japanese classics and contributed to handing them down from generation to generation;for example,by copying "manyoshu" (collection of ten thousand leaves).
his mother was the wet nurse to imperial princess teishi.
therefore,he had a close relationship with emperor gosanjo,and it is said that his second son,fujiwara no arisuke,was in fact an illegitimate child of emperor gosanjo.
