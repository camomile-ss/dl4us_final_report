konoha-don(egg rice bowl with kamaboko)
konoha-don,also referred to as konoha-donburi,is a kind of donburimono(rice dish)which is commonly served in osaka and kyoto area.
it looks like oyako-don(bowl of rice with chicken and egg,literally,parent and child rice bowl),but thinly sliced kamaboko(boiled fish paste)is used instead of chicken to cook with lightly beaten chicken eggs.
depending on what one likes,shiitake mushrooms,green onions and so on can be added.
as it can be made of inexpensive ingredients,it is popular as a common home cooking and is also on the menu of inexpensive restaurants as a standard dish.
it is said that the name came from the comparison of the kamaboko to the tree leaves fluttering down,but the origin is unclear.
in ishikawa prefecture,konoha-don is served with the name of 'tamago-don' (donburimono with egg)at some restaurants.
