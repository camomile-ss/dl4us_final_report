biography
hirofusa was born as the second son of morimasa sue of the sue clan which was a relative of the ouchi clan.
in 1465 hirofusa's older brother hiromasa sue was killed in a battle at the age of 21,and hirofusa took over as head of the family.
hirofusa,too,was killed in the battle of shokoku-ji temple in kyoto,where the fiercest battle of the onin war was fought,in 1468.
the sue's family head was succeeded by their heir hiromori sue.
after hiromori's death,his wife,wishing to pray for the soul of her dead husband,built the anyo-ji temple in niho where her parents lived.
this temple changed its name to ruriko-ji temple in 1492,which was thereafter moved into yamaguchi city and is known today as the kokuho(national treasure)ruriko-ji temple(with its five storied pagoda designated as national treasure).
