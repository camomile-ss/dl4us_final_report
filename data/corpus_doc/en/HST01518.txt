literary works
there are some literary works describing datsua-shiso thought,such as "gakumon no susume" (an encouragement of learning)or "bunmeiron no gairyaku" (an outline of a theory of civilization)written by yukichi fukuzawa.
in the 34th essay collected in "fukuo hyakuwa" (one hundred discourses of fukuzawa),which was entitled 'hanshin-hangi wa fuka nari' (a half-baked notion is unacceptable),yukichi fukuzawa explained datsua-shiso thought as follows.
by the way, 'datsua-shiso' and 'datsua-ron' (literally meaning 'theory of leaving asia')which tend to be confused with each other,should be distinguished,because 'datsua-shiso' is a common thought and 'datsua-ron' (on departure from asia)is a title of an editorial article in the newspaper, "jiji shinpo" (news of current affairs).
