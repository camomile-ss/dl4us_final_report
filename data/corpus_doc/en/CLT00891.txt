datotsu
datotsu refers to a technique in kendo(japanese art of fencing.)
it consists of four types:men,kote,do,and tsuki.
men
men is a type of datotsu to strike a head with a bamboo sword,and is the most basic one.
generally,shomen-uchi strike is used for striking the upper part of the head,while sayu-men is also used to strike the right or left side of the men by 45 degrees.
it is often used for kirikaeshi(a practice method of having a shomen-uchi strike and a sayu-men strike one after the other continuously)or suburi practice strokes.
kote
kote is a type of datotsu to strike a wrist of a partner.
do
it is a type of datotsu to strike a part of the trunk of a partner's body.
migi-do(strike on the right side of the trunk of the body)is used in most cases in principle.
however,a defense way referred to as midokoro-kakushi(or midokoro-yoke)to guard the men,kote and migi-do was widespread for a period of time,and thus hidari-do has also been used.
the hidari-do has been used even after it became considered to be a foul for behavior with no fighting spirit.
tsuki
it is a type of dadotsu to point out a throat of a partner.
although a tsukidare of men-mask,a guard mask of kendo swordmanship,protects the throat,the tsuki is prohibited for junior high school students and younger because it is dangerous if they remove the mask.
