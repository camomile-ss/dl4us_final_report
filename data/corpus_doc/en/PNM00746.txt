there was a time when he worked as an electronics technician at a company in tokyo.
on january 31,1996,his second oldest brother,chojun otani who was the director of the honganji foundation,seceded from the otani school,because of discord with its naikyoku(intra-ministerial bureau),along with his oldest son,narishige otani,who was the chief priest at the time(a time known as ohigashi-sodo strife).
they were the only renshi(brothers and sisters of nobles)with the right to succeed as head priest.
it was decided that since narishige did not have formal succession ceremony,he would not be counted as a successor,and choken succeeded as the 25th chief priest,after his father,kocho,and used homyo jonyo.
monshu succession ceremony was held on november 21,1996.
