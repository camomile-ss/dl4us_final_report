saiho shochishi(an investigating commissioner)
saiho shochishi(an investigating commissioner)was a title of the government official in tang dynasty of china.
summary
in 733,the empire under the tang dynasty,which had previously been divided into 10 administrative regions called 'dao' circuits of inspection,was redivided into 15 dao circuits,each of which had a 'saiho shochishi' stationed.
prior to the redividing of the circuits in 733,when 10 circuits were divided in the reign of the emperor jungjong(tang), 'junsatsushi' (a circuit-riding inspector or investigating commissioner)had been stationed in each circuit.
the official duties of saiho shochishi corresponded to those of 'shu shishi' (provincial governors)in the han dynasty.
accordingly,a 'keikido saihoshi' (a jingji circuit investigating commissioner)corresponded to a colonel director of retainers which was called 'sili xiaowei' (garrison the capital of the executive)in the han dynasty.
each saiho shochishi was stationed in the most important province among all the provinces within his jurisdiction.
later,the official duties of saiho shochishi began to shift gradually to civil administration.
during and after the reign of the emperor suzong(tang),the 'saiho shochishi' was renamed as 'kansatsushi' (an imperial inspector),and the empire was divided into 40 or more dao circuits.
accordingly,the jurisdiction of each inspector extended over more than 10 provinces in the case of a large circuit,and 2 or 3 provinces in the case of a small circuit.
setsudoshi' (a military commissioner in charge of a dao circuit)exercised greater power than 'kansatsushi' (imperial inspector),being a military officer by nature who was assigned the additional civilian post of 'kansatsushi' (imperial inspector).
