summary
it is said that he was in charge of communication under the hideyoshi toyotomi administration.
in 1586,he sent a letter to kagekatsu uesugi to encourage him to go to kyoto under joint signatures with mitsunari ishida and nagamori mashita,and in 1590,he sent a letter to masamune date to urge him to join the war for the invasion of odawara.
after the repression of the oshu district,he went to oshu with his father,and entered the myou-jo castle where a senior vassal of the kasai clan lived and had governance,but an uprising broke out in the territory in response to his father's tyranny.
kiyohisa,who took this seriously,went to teraike-jo castle where his father resided,but the uprising of the kasai clan and the osaki clan broke out in the meantime.
the uprising became large-scale at the instigation of masamune date,and the kimura clan was not able to quell the uprising on their own in the end,and therefore was punished by being deprived of their fief after the war.
later he took over 14,000 koku in bungo province as yoshikiyo's property inheritance,and became toyotomi daimyo(japanese feudal lord).
it is regarded that he was granted the right to use a character from the real name of hideyoshi and called hidemochi around that time.
at the battle of sekigahara,he joined the attack unit against tango tanabe-jo castle(maizuru-jo castle)and defended the omi seta-hashi bridge,but failed to defend it and fled.
he was punished by being deprived of his fief after the war.
in 1615,he entered osaka-jo castle at the summer siege of osaka,and died in battle.
