history
although this temple is reported to have been founded by prince shotoku,some have said it was originally built in the middle heian period by kanku(882-970),a monk of the shingon sect who had received from cloistered emperor uda a ceremonial kanjo(the esoteric buddhist ritual of pouring water over the top of a monk's head).
shakanyorai-zo(the statue of buddha shakamuni),which has been reserved in sagano seiryo-ji temple,was originally implored in tang(china)and brought to japan by chonen in 987,whereupon it was installed in this jobonrendai-ji temple and later transferred to seiryo-ji temple.
jobonrendai-ji temple once had 12 sub-temples within its premises,and accordingly it was also called 'juni-bo temple' (the temple having 12 sub-temples).
