jidai gyoretsu
the jidai gyoretsu is a pageant or procession in festivals where the participants wear costumes from the kofun period(tumulus period)through the early showa period,reproduced after research into each period,
particularly,the jidai gyoretsu often takes place in urban festivals,which were begun in the modern era and in many cases,is intended to promote tourism in the postwar era by focusing on local historical resources.
unlike a traditional festival managed directly by local residents,urban festivals are often initiated by local governments and,since they have few religious characteristics or traditional restrictions,tend to be flamboyant with lots of events in order to attract crowds.
