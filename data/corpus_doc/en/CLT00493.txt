dried fish
himono(dried fish)is a generic term for processed foods made by drying various sea foods such as fish.
drying makes the surface of seafood become hard,which ensures a better shelf life.
the drying process also makes the distinct texture and taste to the seafood.
fish is generally cleaned,butterflied and dried but small fish such as sardines are normally dried whole and served as 'maruboshi'(dried whole fish).
this is a common processing method used in areas where there is a large volume of fish caught and dried fish is being produced in countries around the world in addition to japan.
aong with rice,miso soup,pickles,japanese omelet and nori seaweed sheet,dried fish is one of the essential items on the breakfast table in japan.
it is also popular as a souvenier in the oceanfront areas throughout japan.
kanbutsu(dry food)is another form of dried seafood,but is made by thoroughly drying part of it,or the whole seafood.
ventilation is considered particularly important when making dried fish and it is believed that the best dried fish is produced when it is exposed to dry air blowing in winter.
in summer,the intense heat of the sun cooks the fish spoiling its flavor.
in view of the foregoing,it is said that shade-dried fish tastes better.
even when the term 'drying in the sun' is used,it is common to dry fish in the sun for approximately one hour and then placed into the shade for the rest of drying process.
the photograph accompanying this article shows fish drying in the sun,but they remain in the sun for a very brief period and approximately one hour after being dried,the fish will be available to sell.
