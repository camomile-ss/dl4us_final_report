jin(position)
"jin" was a place where military officers of rokuefu(six guard divisions)lined up in the imperial court.
officers of konoefu(the headquarters of the inner palace guards),hyoefu(headquarters of the middle palace guards),emonfu(headquarters of the outer palace guards)stood by in jinza(court,also referred to as joza)to work on rotating shifts.
it was called jinchoku.
later,the conference site of kugyo(high court nobles)was moved to the building which used to be the jinza of konoefu,and it became the standard.
for that reason,the conference for agreement on state affairs by those kugyo was referred to as "jin no sadame" or "jingi."
