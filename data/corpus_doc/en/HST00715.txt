summary
maizuru prefecture was established under the policy of haihan-chiken and lasted only three months.
maizuru domain was originally called tanabe domain of the tango province,but the name overlapped with tanabe domain of the kii province.
therefore,it was renamed after maizuru-jo castle which was a pseudonym for tanabe-jo castle(tango province)by order of the daijokan(grand council of state).
the prefectural government was in the maizuru-jo castle,but later,it was consolidated into toyooka prefecture along with miyazu prefecture and mineyama prefecture of the same tango province.
