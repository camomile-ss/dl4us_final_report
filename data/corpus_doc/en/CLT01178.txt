sukisha(also referred to as sukimono)is a familiar name for a person infatuated with geido(accomplishments of art).

history
suki(数寄)' originally meant 'like(好き),' and this way of writing has circulated as a unique phonetic equivalent.
suki' refers especially to the way someone devotes to a certain accomplishment while not making it as his of her profession,and has lead to such present day colloquial expressions such as 'you're a suki,too' (you really like that thing)and 'monozuki' (whimsical person).
in ancient times,it seems 'sukimono' referred to someone who was infatuated with creating waka(a 31-syllables japanese poem),but it is said that 'suki' gradually changed to refer to renga(linked poem)as it became popular in the muromachi period.
in addition,during the momoyama period,chanoyu(the tea ceremony)became popular amongst the wealthy machi-shu(merchant class),and the meaning of 'suki' changed from renga to chanoyu.
due to this,during the edo period,a house for those suki,the 'sukiya-zukuri style,' became an alternate name for a teahouse.
furthermore,chanoyu became popular amongst the business leaders in the modern times,but these chajins(masters of the tea ceremony)usually collect many special utensils;being similar to the sukimonos of the momoyama period,they are called 'the modern sukimonos.'
including takashi masuda and sankei hara,kaichiro nezu(the first),ichizo kobayashi,and keita goto are famous examples.
