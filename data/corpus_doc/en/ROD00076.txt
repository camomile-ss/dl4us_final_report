aimanomachi-dori street
the aimanomachi-dori street is a street runningnorth-south through kyoto city.
it runs from marutamachi-dori street in the north to an area slightly south of shichijo-dori street in the south.
it is divided between aneyakoji-dori street and takatsuji-dori street and between matsubara-dori street and manjuji-dori street.
it did not exist in heiankyo and was built by hideyoshi toyotomi according to his tensho zoning policy.
this street was "between" takakura-dori street and higashinotoin-dori street,which became the origin for the name of the street.
according to a theory,the name comes from the way the street(corresponding to the area between the current gojo-dori street and the shichijo-dori street)divided a district in front of the gate of shinshu honbyo-old and new areas partitioned by the zoning-into east and west sides.
no new streets were built in the area due to the zoning between aneyakoji-dori street and takatsuji-dori street,because it had been already urbanized.
