"otomoshu" were a group of busho(military commander)attendants who proceeded to the ancient capital of kyoto from kamakura and devoted themselves to raising shogun takauji ashikaga's army.
descendants of the busho who served as attendants in this group succeeded the title of otomoshu.
otomoshu within the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government head by a shogun).
