the origin and history
july 20,1981:
this temple was erected as hogo-in temple.
kaiki(patron of a temple in its founding)was nikken shonin,the 67th head priest of nichirenshoshu taiseki-ji temple.
musuzan jitsudo-ji temple was erected in maizuru city on may 9,1961,because the chief priest at the time sided with shoshinkai(correct faith association).
august 21,1982:
since the chief priest in jitsudo-ji temple at the time denied the position of nikken shonin,the 67th head priest of nichirenshoshu taiseki-ji temple as a head priest,he was excommunicated for disobeying the religious institute and regulations of the nichiren sho sect.
despite this,he has continued to occupy and reside in jitsudo-ji temple until now.
july 23,1985:
after the temple was relocated to its present place,its sango-jigo(mountain name-temple name)was changed to kakushosan hogo-ji temple.
