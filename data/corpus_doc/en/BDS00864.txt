rokusai nenbutsu
rokusai nenbutsu is one of odori nenbutsu(chanting of prayers while dancing).
it is said that odori nenbutsu was invented by kuya,a buddhist monk in the middle heian period.
in the medieval times,a complicated rendition of the phrase 'namu amidabutsu' (prayer for amida buddha)was created,accompanied at first only by a gong,which,with the addition of a japanese drum,developed into ohayashi(japanese-style band music)and was performed on rokusai-nichi(the sabbath/six days per month),thus called 'rokusai nenbutsu.'
incidentally,rokusai-nichi refers to the sabbath when laymen were required to obey hassai-kai(eight precepts,or the eight commandments),which took place six days a month:8th,14th,15th,23th,29th,and 30th days of the month.
rokusai nenbutsu is divided into two styles:the hoshina-ji temple(kofuku-ji temple on mt.hoshina:tanaka kamiyanagi-cho,sakyo ward,kyoto city)style,which showcases the authentic form of traditional odori nenbutsu,and the kuya-do temple(kosho-ji temple gokuraku-in on mt.shiun:kameya-cho,nakagyo ward,kyoto city)style,which is characterized by a strong influence in entertainment.
they are performed mainly in kyoto and neighboring areas.
