station name
many of the station names in the central part of kyoto city are given under the following system:give 'a name of a street running north-south' to a station on the line running east-west that crosses the street or give 'a name of a street running east-west' to a station on the line running north-south(e.g.,kyoto municipal subway karasuma line)that crosses the street;accordingly,the station was temporarily named after 'tenjingawa-dori' (which is the name of a street running near the station)before the station name 'uzumasa-tenjingawa' was finally selected by taking into account a request by local people.
among the public opinions for a station name gathered in february 2007, 'tenjingawa' was selected as number one,accounting for 51%and 'uzumasa' as number two,accounting for 12%;consequently,the two were combined for the station name.
station layout
there is a concourse on the first basement level and an island platform with platform doors serving two tracks on the third basement level.
unlike other stations,trains bound for hamaotsu arrive at the station to the west of the platform.
a bus locator system is installed in front of a ticket gate to provide real-time information on the locations of buses.
when the station opened in january 2008,part of the stairs connecting the ground and the concourse level was not placed in service,an entrance was blocked and some above-ground bus terminals were incomplete,so route buses stopped at temporary bus stops installed on either sanjo-dori street or tenjingawa-dori street.
a portion of the above-ground bus terminal was put into service in late march.
a bank automated teller machine will be installed on the concourse level.
trains bound for rokujizo are set to arrive at one side of the platform and trains bound for hamaotsu arrive at the other side during the day,but it depends on the time zone at which side of the platform the respective trains arrive.
