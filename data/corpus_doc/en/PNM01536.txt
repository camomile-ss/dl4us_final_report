in 1018,he was consulted about rebuilding the burnt down kofuku-ji and engyo-ji temples.

there is an anecdote that yamato no kami(governor of yamato province)fujiwara no sukekimi,who noted his fear of cats,confined kiyokado in a room and frightened him with cats as a punishment for unpaid kanmotsu(tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes)to urge him to pay.
