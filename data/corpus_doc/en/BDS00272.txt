chonen(february 25,938-april 25,1016)was a priest at todai-ji temple during the mid-heian period.
his secular surname was hata.
he was from kyoto.
he was also called法済大師.
he learned the san-lun teachings from kanri at todai-ji temple,and he learned shingon esoteric buddhism from gengo at ishiyama-dera temple in omi province.
he had the ambition to enter sung at an early age,and traveled to sung(dynasty)in 983.
he made a pilgrimage to mt.tendai,then to benkei and mt.wutai shan.
after receiving the daishi-go title and新印大蔵経from song taizong,he returned to japan.
on his way home,he carved a copy of the wooden seated statue of shakya nyorai(shakyamuni)),which was created by king udayana,and brought it home in 986 with the document regarding its origin stored within the wooden carving.
the following year in 987,the seated statue of shakya nyorai was enshrined at joborendai-ji temple in kyoto.
in the same year,he was appointed hokkyo(the third highest rank for buddhist priests),and from the beginning of 989,he served as the todai-ji betto(secretary in the office of temple)for 3 years.
the seated statue of shakya nyorai,that was brought into japan by chonen,was enshrined in seiryo-ji temple,at the foot of mt.atago,where chonen vowed to build a temple to enshrine shakya,which began its construction before chonen left for sung and was completed after his death.
