types of sashimono
among various schools in the sashimono world,kyo-sashimono in kyoto and edo-sashimono in tokyo are particularly famous.
since kyo-sashimono was developed in the noble culture of the heian period and its products were mainly used at the imperial court and by court nobles,graceful and fine workmanship constitutes a characteristic feature of this.
kyo-sashimono includes tea ceremony equipment such as tea boxes,trays,hikimono(turned articles such as bowls),and magemono(round containers made by bending slips of japanese cedar),as well as furnishings such as cabinets,shelves,and desks.
on the other hand,edo-sashimono was developed in edo,and its products were mainly used by samurai,townspeople,and merchants.
therefore,excessive decorations are removed and instead,sober-colored lacquer is applied on simple wood grain.
taking advantage of beautiful wood grain of the material characterizes edo-sashimono.
