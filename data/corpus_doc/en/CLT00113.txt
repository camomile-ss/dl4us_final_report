yoshingo-ryu school
the yoshingo-ryu school is a school of flower arrangement established by seiryusai sakurai ichinyokoji(ichinyo).
when ichinyo dedicated flowers to omuro-gosho,ninna-ji temple,he was appointed to omuro-gosho kamu shoku(the person in charge of flower arrangement)and received an order that "as the feature is real,you shall be called yoshin" (literally,real feature.)
today,there are 2 branch schools:one is the school succeeded by a descendant of ichinyo,and another is a school where iemoto(the head family of a school)is yatadera daimonbo.
the school succeeded by the descendant of ichinyo is called the "yoshin-ryu" school.
