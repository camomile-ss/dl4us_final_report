koma no shoun
koma no shoun(year of birth and death unknown)was a priest in the nara period.
it is believed that he was the third son of koma no jakko from the royal family of goguryeo(a kingdom of korea).
he was a disciple of shoraku shonin(teranenso),the high priest of the temple.
the master,shoraku,tried to build a temple to worship the shoten buddha of joy(a small statue of buddha carried beside the body),which he brought from goguryeo as a memorial for jakko,who was believed to be the father of shoten.
however,as shoraku died in 751,konin,another disciple of shoraku,built shoten shoraku-ji temple(hidaka city,saitama prefecture)of the hosso sect of buddhism(japanese equivalent of the chinese faxiang sect)under the will of the deceased and buried him in the yard of the temple.
shoten shoraku-ji temple
the temple is located in hidaka city,saitama prefecture.
the official name of the temple is komazan shoten-in shoraku-ji.
in 1345,the temple was converted to shingon buddhism from the hosso sect of buddhism by shukai shonin(the high priest).
in 1580,enshin,the 25th shonin(high priest)installed fudo myoo(acala-one of the five kings of wisdom)as honzon(the principal object of worship in the temple)and he enshrined shoten buddha of joy,the previous honzon,as an associated deity.
this fudo myoo is a small buddhist statue kept inside a bigger buddhist statue made by kobo daishi(posthumous title of the priest kukai).
