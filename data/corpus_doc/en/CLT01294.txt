nogaku kyokai(the nohgaku performers' association)
nogaku kyokai is an organization comprised of nogakushi(noh actors)who belong to the schools that have directly inherited the methods of yamato-yoza or yamato-shiza(four sarugaku performance groups in the yamato province).
its official name is koeki-shadanhojin(public interest incorporated association)nogaku kyokai.
summary
the performing art now known as nogaku was established during the muromachi period by kanami,zeami,onami and zenchiku konparu,and during the shokuho period,the so-called yamato-yoza,consisting of kanze-za,hosyo-za,konparu-za and kongo-za,held a dominant position as a performing group which specialized in sarugaku(comical mimicry and speech performance),except for kurokawa noh.
during the early edo period,yamato-shiza was regarded as the official musical function of the edo bakufu,and it was called shiza ichiryu,together with kita-ryu,which was derived from kongo-za.
nogaku kyokai is an organization for the nogakushi who have inherited those schools that were part of yamato-shiza and who are professionally involved in noh performances,not the kind taken as a lesson by amateurs.
admissions requirements
to qualify for membership in nogaku kyokai,one is required to get referrals from a current member of the association and from the soke(head of family,originator)of the school,to which he or she belongs,and to be a nogakushi of one of the following schools;kanze-ryu,hosho-ryu,konparu-ryu,kongo-ryu and kita-ryu for shite-kata(main roles);takayasu-ryu,fukuo-ryu and hosho-ryu for waki-kata(supporting actors);isso-ryu,morita-ryu and fujita-ryu for fue-kata(roles who play the flute);ko-ryu,kosei-ryu,okura-ryu and kanze-ryu for kotsuzumi-kata(small hand drum players);kadono-ryu,takayasu-ryu,ishii-ryu,okura-ryu and kanze-ryu for otsuzumi-kata(large hand drum players);kanze-ryu and konparu-ryu for taiko-kata(drum players),and;okura-ryu and izumi-ryu for kyogen-kata(comic actors).
additionally,one must withdraw from nogaku kyokai when he or she goes out of business,which means that being a member of the association is in effect equivalent to being a regular nogakushi.
even the schools that were once part of yamato-shiza do not qualify for membership in the association if they have gone out of business like kasuga-ryu of fue-kata.
although za-ryu is still active in sadoga-shima island,it does not qualify,either.
