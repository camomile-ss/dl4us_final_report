it has the largest number of the passengers among the six stations.
it is a modern-style,elevated rail station with two platforms and four tracks.
limited express tickets and commuter passes can be purchased at this station.
barrier-free facilities,such as the escalator between the concourse and the platform,and the elevators that connect the concourse with each platform,were installed relatively early.
when the station was at ground level,it was limited to serving five-car trains because there were railroad crossings at both ends of the platform.

under the elevated rail tracks,there are restaurants and grocery stores for the convenience of passengers.
bicycles and motorized bicycles(categories one and two)can be left in the municipal bicycle parking area.

the lines toward both iseda station and kutsukawa station slope downward,so trains run efficiently by accelerating on the downward slope after leaving okubo station and slowing down on the upward slope when coming to a stop at okubo station having come from either of the two stations.
