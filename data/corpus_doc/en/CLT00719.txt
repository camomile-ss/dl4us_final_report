enteki(the long-distance shooting)
enteki(the long-distance shooting)is one of the kyudo(japanese art of archery)events established by the rules of all nippon kyudo federation.
the shooting range is 90m,70m,60m or 50m,but currently a range of 60m is most widely used and the majority of kyudo dojo(training hall)for enteki is designed at the range of 60m.
there are two methods of game,tekichu-sei(the accuracy system)and tokuten-sei(the point system).
many players use slim arrows designed exclusively for enteki,in order to deal with a long distance.
in today's national sports festival,there are two types of kyudo games,tekichu-sei kinteki(the regular close-ranged shooting)and tokuten-sei enteki(60m).
