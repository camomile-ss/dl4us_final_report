the united stated implicitly admitted japanese annexation of korea and dominance over southern manchuria,and japan admitted limitations on the immigration to california.
background
after the spanish-american war,the united states became a major power in the eastern asia.
the japanese government at that time felt increasingly threatened by gaining of hawaii and the philippines by the united states since it led to the aggressive economic policies in qing.
meanwhile,the united states felt unrest about japanese ambition towards the territorial profit from qing and its modern and powerful navy after the russo-japanese war.
the agreement was valued to greatly release tensions between the united states and japan.
however,the agreement weaked the united states influence in china over japanese dominance through japanese approach to the russian empire after the russo-japanese agreement in 1907 and increasing economic investment in manchuria,
