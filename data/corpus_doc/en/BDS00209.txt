raigo
raigo(1002-1084)was a japanese monk of the tendai sect in the mid heian period.
his father was fujiwara no ariie,iga no kuni no kami(governor of iga province).
he lived in jissoin temple,studied under shinyo of onjo-ji temple(mii-dera temple)and learned ho(dharma,which has various meanings such as order,rule,law and custom)from engyo.
gaining fame for the efficacy of his incantation and prayer,he prayed for the birth of an imperial prince for emperor shirakawa in 1074,and after the birth of imperial prince atsufumi he requested the emperor reward him with the establishment of a kaidan(platform for teaching the precepts to monks and nuns)in onjo-ji temple,but his request was dismissed due to opposition from enryaku-ji temple.
bearing a grudge because of this,he killed himself by fasting to death,and it was widely believed that he became a rancorous ghost taking the shape of an iron rat(a huge rat as large as a bull with a stone body and iron teeth),and bit and tore the buddhist scriptures belonging to enryaku-ji temple,as well as causing the death of the four-year-old imperial prince atsufumi.
the legend of his taking the shape of an iron rat is known through the "heike monogatari" (the tale of the heike)and "taiheiki" (the record of the great peace).
bakin kyokutei wrote "raigo ajari kaisoden" (tale of raigo ajari(a master in esoteric buddhism)transforming into a specter of a rat)(raigo-ajari kaiso-den)as yomihon(copy for reading)in the tokugawa period.
