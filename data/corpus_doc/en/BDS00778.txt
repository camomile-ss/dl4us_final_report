ajikan
the term "ajikan" refers to a method of meditation introduced by kukai(a buddhist priest)during the heian period.
it is also referred to as ajikan yoga,or mikkyo(esoteric buddhism)yoga.
sitting with the back perfectly upright,breathing in a natural rhythmical way,practitioners meditate while watching the bonji(sanskrit characters)which is a manifestation of dainichi nyorai(mahavairocana)in the gachirin(a perfect round circle meant to represent the full moon,and the buddha's knowledge and virtue which are considered perfect and all-encompassing)on a lotus flower painted on a hanging scroll.
originally,ajikan was practiced by monks of the shingon sect as a method to refine the mind,and was transmitted among the temples of the shingon sect.
meditative practice methods include susokukan(breath counting meditation),asokukan(breathing meditation),and gachirinkan(moon disc meditation).
