history
the temple was built in 1368 by yoriyuki hosokawa,a busho(japanese military commander)who was a kanrei(shogunal deputy)of the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
yoriyuki became a believer of hekitan shuko(sokyo zenji)and entered the priesthood.
although the actual kaisan(a temple founder as the first chief priest)of the temple was hekitan shuko,hekitan treated muso soseki,his priest brother,as a kanjo kaizan.
the temple's fortunes rose as a chokugan-ji(temple built at the order of the emperor)in the period of the northern and southern courts(japan),but they dwindled after the buddhist temple was burned down in a fire caused by the onin war.
it was rebuilt in the middle of the edo period,whereupon it belonged to tenryu-ji temple.
it used to belong to the rinzai sect,but in 1968 it became an independent,nonsectarian temple.
