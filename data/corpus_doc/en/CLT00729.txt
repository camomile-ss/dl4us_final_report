history
gyuhi came down from tang(china)to japan in the heian period.
the reason why gyuhi is also written as牛皮(cow hide)or牛肥(cattle fertilizer)in kanji(chinese characters)is considered as that,gyuhi of older times was darkish and looked like cow hide as it was made from unpolished glutinous rice.
it is said that the characters of求肥(demand fertilizer)were applied later because of the strong tendency to detest meat eating in japan.
