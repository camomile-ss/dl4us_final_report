daisenno
the term daisenno means the system of paying kuji(public service),nengu(tribute),and/or jishi(land tax)in cash,instead of in kind,that was introduced in medieval japan at the shoen(manor),kokugaryo(territories governed by provincial government office),and/or bukeryo(territories of samurai family).
this system started in the mid-kamakura period when commerce and industries developed nationwide thanks to boosting agricultural production and the circulation of sung currency and spread throughout the nation in the period of the northern and southern courts.
