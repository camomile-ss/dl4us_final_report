yuminoki-jo castle
yuminoki-jo castle was a castle in tango province(present-day iwataki,yosano-cho,kyoto prefecture).
the inatomi clan built the castle at the end of the kamakura period,and made it their residence for generations.
during the warring state period,yoshisada isshiki,a child of yoshimichi isshiki,was attacked by tadaoki hosakawa.
consequently,yoshisada moved from takebeyama-jo castle to yuminoki-jo castle.
from the following year,the hosokawa clan repeatedly attacked the yuminoki-jo castle,but the lord of the castle,sukenao inatomi continued to repel them with a small force.
he kept on resisting until yoshisada isshiki was murdered by the hosokawa clan.
it is said that the castle was relinquished as a result of peace negotiations after yoshisada's death.
the castle is categorized as yamajiro(a castle built on a mountain to take advantage of the mountain's topography),and the ruins of kuruwa(walls of a castle),a karabori(a dry moat)and dorui(earthen walls for fortification)remain.
