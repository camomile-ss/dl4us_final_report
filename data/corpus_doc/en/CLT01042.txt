shiro shozoku
shiro shozoku means white clothing in the broad sense.
it also means being dressed in white from head to toe.
in a more limited sense,it means hitoe(a single layer of kimono)in yukata style(an informal cotton kimono's style)worn by shinto priests,miko(shrine maiden)and ascetic buddhist monks in divine rituals.
it is also called shiraginu/byakue.
originally,in the heian period,shiro shozoku was worn under hakama(formal men's divided skirt),with cotton stuffed within,for cold weather.
later it got thinner and started to serve as underwear or underclothes for various kinds of costumes.
presently,it is known as outerwear worn by miko over juban(undershirt for kimono).
