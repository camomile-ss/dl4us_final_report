fujiwara no kanetsune
fujiwara no kanetsune(1000-june 17,1043)was a court noble in the heian period.
he was the third son of fujiwara no michitsuna,dainagon(chief councilor of state).
he was shosanmi(senior third rank)and sangi(councilor).
because his mother's sister,minamoto no rinshi,was the lawful wife of his uncle,fujiwara no michinaga,he went out into the world as an adopted son of michinaga.
he celebrated his attainment of manhood and was raised to jugoinojo(junior fifth rank,upper grade)in 1011.
from then on,he was given repeated promotions through the influence of michinaga and in 1018,at the young age of 19,he was raised to jusanmi(junior third rank)and became a court noble.
in 1023,he was appointed sangi(councilor),but after then was not promoted due to his illness.
at last,in 1037,he was promoted to shosanmi(senior third rank)and in 1043,he retired,becoming a priest.
in the same,he died.
in the toyoakari no sechi-e(a seasonal court banquet,which took place the day after niiname-sai festival in november)in 1024,he paid a tribute of maihime(dancing girl)for gosechi no mai dance(dance performance as part of a harvest festival)as his duty;however,he created an incident where he confined himself in the anteroom for the maihime on the excuse of his illness("shoyuki")(the diary of fujiwara no sanesuke).
the atsuie's descendants survived as middle-rank nobles and in the insei period(during the period of the government by the retired emperor),fujiwara no sueyuki and his son fujiwara no sadayoshi were raised to court nobles;however,they were discontinued down to the medieval period.
