setotaisho
setotaisho is a japanese specter that is introduced in "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (one hundred bags in idleness)which is a collection of specters illustrations by sekien toriyama,and it is a type of tsukumo-gami(gods to a variety of things)of chinaware.
a specter which looks like an assortment of setomono(ceramics which were originally made in the regions of seto,aichi prefecture)is depicted as wearing an armor made up of setomono.
it is not a specter that actually has a legend of some sort,but it is said to be depicted as a creation imaging guan yu,based on the analects of cao cao and guan yu who were the characters from "sanguo zhi" (history of the three kingdoms in china),and there is also a theory that it was depicting a struggle for power between two types of ceramics,setomono and chinaware.
