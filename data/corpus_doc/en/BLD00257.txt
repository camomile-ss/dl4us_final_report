karamete-mon gate
karamete-mon gate is one of the castle gates located at the karameteguchi(back gateway),as opposed to ote-mon gate(main gate)being at the front of the castle.
in times of emergency,the karamete-mon gate allowed people,including the feudal lord,to escape from a castle or escape to outside the walls surrounding a castle.
the karamete-mon gate building itself was often inconspicuous,being small and narrow and in some instances,the karamete-mon gate was built according to the specification of a compact kabuki-mon gate and not a yagura-mon gate,but it was very securely designed to be adequately guarded by a small number of people,in contrast to a large koguchi(castle entrance),such as the ote-mon gate.
the bridge at this gate was often made of wood.
