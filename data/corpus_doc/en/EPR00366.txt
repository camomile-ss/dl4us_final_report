it was located west of suzaku-oji street,south of sanjo,and north of shijo,and it occupied eight cho(blocks)of the eastern part of ukyo shijo ichibo(it had largest scale next to daidairi-the greater imperial palace).

later,emperor suzaku also repaired it and lived there after abdicating the throne.
in 950,it caught fire,and later,it was restored by emperor murakami.
however,after emperor enyu,since it was not used as goin,it gradually deteriorated,and its functions were transferred to satodairi(a temporary palace).
