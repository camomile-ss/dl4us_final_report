station name
the station names on the subways in kyoto city are given in the following manner:give 'a name of a street running north-south' to a station on the line running east-west that crosses the street,or give 'a name of a street running east-west' to a station on the line running north-south(karasuma line)that crosses the street.
the station was temporarily given the name 'nishioji station' but it was too easily confused with nishioji station on the jr kyoto line,so it was decided to add 'oike' to 'nishioji' in order to have the same name as the crossing located just above the station,like karasuma-oike station.
