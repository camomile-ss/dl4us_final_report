history
most of senchado utensils are of chinese origin,but this charyo is a utensil of japanese origin.
there is some charyo which is a 'karamono' (things imported from china).
however,many of them are not suited for the use as they are conversion of bamboo used for ude-makura(arm rest to avoid staining sleeve)that is used in calligraphy,in mainland china.
an established theory for the origin of charyo is that the utensil was designed by baisao(a monk of obakushu sect)in the middle of the edo period for convenience of measuring and pouring in of tea leaves.
charyo is designed by baisao whose motto was simplicity and honorable poverty therefore it is believed that charyo was a simple utensil of bamboo that was divided two or three times in appropriate size.
the shape is still used at present days.
later on charyo with chinese style poem or chinese style sculpture on the backside came into fashion as a literatures' hobby.
the works of famous literati and craftsman were traded with high price.
comparison with chinese tea.
now,there is a similar utensil called 'chasoku' (scoops for green tea leaves)in chinese tea,but the shape is not similar to charyo as they are in spoon shaped or shovel shaped.
chashaku(bamboo tea spoon for making tea)is also used in chinese tea depending on type of the tea.
