outline
whole of university
kyoto university is the second oldest national university in japan and its history began as the imperial university,which means the university established by the great empire of japan.
taking its scale,such as the budget and teaching staff,into account,kyoto university,as a whole,can be ranked the second in japan,but actually,it can be equal to tokyo university,no.1 university,in the quality of its very best students and teaching staff,who tackles the cutting-edge research.
this high quality is kept on the spiritual basis of "academic freedom",the motto of kyoto university,and this spirit can be seen in,besides the academic field,energetic activities,such as those of the student autonomy.
and kyoto university has also played the role of a cultural transmitter in kyoto,symbolized by the rock concert held in its west hall.
it has produced more nobel prize winners than any other universities in japan(until today,six have been produced).
spirit(or motto,philosophy,creed)of foundation
since it was set up,kyoto university has kept "academic freedom" as the spirit of its foundation.
and this spirit is echoed in the university's basic ideas&policies,which were codified after the university became the national university corporation.
education and research
in addition to its undergraduate and graduate schools,kyoto university has 13 research institutes and 17 research centers.
this number is the top of all universities in japan(as of march,2006).
among those,9 research institutes&centers serve as "joint research laboratories" & "joint research centers",which means its research facilities are also used by other universities and institutions.
this system of joint research laboratories was firstly adopted by yukawa institute for theoretical physics of kyoto university.
kyoto university people think that these facts symbolize the public character of kyoto university,that is,the role that it has played as the representative base in japan of the academic research over wide-ranging fields.
school tradition and feature
far from the downtown of kyoto city,kyoto university is in the calm surroundings that still retain some traces of the historic city,so students and teaching staff can concentrate on the studies in such calmness,and the university's motto "academic freedom",implying everything related to students' affairs should be left to their autonomy,can be seen in,for example,the annual november festival,the graffiti on the statue of prof.orita,and the students' disguise in the graduation ceremony.
however,as old constructions of kyoto university get remodeled and rebuilt,traces of the historic city fade out,and the school tradition of kyoto university is on the same path,some kyoto university people say.
there once existed a professor who came to work on foot because he had no money to get on the streetcar,and also,some professors who underwent the mobilization of students for labor during the world war 2,but most of them passed away,and even the atmosphere of the showa era,perceived in the generation of 1960s' student movement,is becoming a thing of the past.
before the war,kyoto university was typically symbolized by bankara(students' rough appearances)of sanko(third high school,the predecessor of kyoto university)or self-supporting students,but from the generation of the fierce "examination war",people from rich families have noticeably increased among its students and professors.
university's history
historical sketch
kyoto university originated from nagasaki yojyosho(later renamed nagasaki seitokukan),which was founded in nagasaki in a.d.1861(bunkyu 1).
the science and chemistry section of nagasaki seitokukan was to be transferred to kaiseijo(today's tokyo university)in edo by the name of "school of science and chemistry",but this wasn't realized in the turmoil of the meiji restoration.
in a.d.1868(keio 4),the meiji government decided to open "school of science and chemistry" in osaka in the name of "seimikyoku" (later,school of science),and did so in 1869.
in 1870,school of science was annexed to school of western learning,and was transformed into kaiseijo.
kaiseijo changed its name one after another,from osaka english school,osaka vocational school,osaka junior high school,and to university branch,and under the ordinance of junior high school,which was proclaimed in 1886,it was renamed third advanced junior high school.
third advanced junior high school was transferred to a new place purchased in yoshida-cho,kyoto city,in august 1st,1889.
under the ordinance of high school,proclaimed in 1894,third advanced junior high school was transformed into third high school(under the old system)(in this article, "third high school" indicates third high school under the old system,if there's no particular explanation).
after the ordinance of imperial university was established,there were many voices that an imperial university should be set up in the kinki district as in kanto,but they were shelved for a long time owing to financial difficulties.
in 1895,kinmochi saionji proposed that third high school should be graded up to the imperial university with the compensation earned from china after the sino-japanese war.
the plan adopted in the end was that third high school should be transferred to the south side of higashi-ichijyo dori(today's yoshida-south campus)and its premises left behind should be used by the university,and its budget passed the next year.
in june 18th,1897,kyoto imperial university started as the imperial ordinance about its foundation was enacted.
originally,the college of law was planned to be initially established in 1898,but the college of science and engineering was set up in 1897--one year earlier than expected and the same year as the foundation--because of the upsurge of its applicants.
and then,other colleges were established for about a decade from the foundation,such as the colleges of law and medicine in 1898,and the college of letters in 1906.
hiroji kinoshita assumed the first president,who was the chief of the special office of educational affairs in the ministry of education.
kojyuro nakagawa assumed the "secretary",the corresponding position of the bureau chief.
partly because the then president wanted it,kyoto imperial university learned from the german university system that put an emphasis on the freedom of research,teaching,and learning,
this principle,led by yoshito takane,is said to have affected the present "academic freedom",and,though changed when the college of law graduates got the bad grades in the examination of high civil servants,it surely marks the dawn of the unique school tradition that took root in kyoto imperial university.
in 1919,the system of colleges was transformed into that of faculties.
some faculties were set up one after another,such as the faculty of economics,divided from the faculty of law in the same year above,and the faculty of agriculture in 1923.
in the year that the faculty of agriculture was newly established,the central hall of the university was completed,which has the clock tower,now familiar as the university's symbol.
in 1926,the institute for chemical research,the first institute attached to the university,was completed.
entering the showa era,kyoto imperial university came to be struck frequently by events related to the professors' thoughts,which reflected the social conditions at that time when the control over thoughts was strengthened.
in 1928,the ministry of education urged prof.hajime kawakami,the authority of the marxian economics,to resign,and the university's faculty meeting also concluded he should quit,so professor kawakami was forced to leave.
moreover,in 1933,prof.yukitoki takigawa in the faculty of law,was laid off by ichiro hatoyama,the then minister of education,for the reason professor takigawa's theory about the criminal law included "marxist thought",so all teaching staff of the faculty submitted their resignation letters as the demonstration against the layoff,and kyoto university's president also declared his resignation when he met with the minister,but the ministry's splitting operation worked and seven of the staff,including mr.takigawa,were forced to leave in the end,and this whole event is what's called, "takigawa jiken(oppression of professor takigawa)".
as the war regime got strengthened,some programs complying with the national policy were set up,such as history of japanese spirit(in the faculty of letters),principles of east asian economics policies(in the faculty of economics),and aeronautics&fuel chemistry(in the faculty of engineering),and after the pacific war began, "loyal patriots' corps of kyoto imperial university" was formed for organizing students in the military style.
in 1943,the draft deferment was stopped for the humanities' students,and they went to the battlefront one after another.
in the farewell party of kyoto university,held before the departure of students for the battlefront,they are said to have done a visit to heian shrine with the university president at the front,and to have prayed for the war's victory.
after the end of the world war 2,yukitoki takigawa and others,who left the university owing to "takigawa jiken",came back to the university,while some professors were dismissed in the purge by ghq.
in 1947,just the 50th anniversary of the university's foundation,the word "imperial" was removed from the name,and the university was renamed "kyoto university",and in 1949,it annexed daisan kotogakko to itself.
in the same year,hideki yukawa,the professor in the faculty of science,became the first japanese nobel prize winner,so kyoto university established the yukawa memorial hall for its commemoration,and this hall was transformed into the yukawa institute for theoretical physics afterward.
in 1968,kyoto university's branch of the association of young doctors(ayd)called on an applicant for a boycott of the entrance examination of the graduate school of medicine,but the applicant rejected it,so a member of ayd beat the applicant,and this event,what's called "seiiren jiken" (ayd event),triggered the indefinite strike of the faculty of liberal arts,and the lockout of the student union.
kyoto university escaped the cancellation of the entrance exam,which really happened in tokyo university,but its graduation ceremony was forced to cancel for the first time after the war,and some buildings in the campus remained locked out until the next academic year's september,when they were all lifted.
in 1992,the faculty of integrated human studies was established,and the next year,the college of liberal arts and sciences was closed and kyoto university changed itself into the university prioritizing its graduate schools,and this was when the university's present faculties and graduate schools were all completed.
in 1997,kyoto university's centennial anniversary of foundation came around.
and in 2004,the national university's corporation law went into effect as one of the national organizations' reform,which was called for at that time,and kyoto university transformed itself into the national university corporation in line with the law.
from the history told above,this article sets kyoto university's origin year in 1869,when seimikyoku,third high school's predecessor,was founded,and university's foundation year in 1897,when kyoto imperial university was born.

university song
words by yakyu mizunashi,music by kan'ichi shimofusa.
this song was established in 1940,as an answer to the "imperial rescript for the young students" from the emperor in 1939.
the lyrics of the song were selected from pieces written by the university students in 1939,and the piece of mr.mizunashi,a graduate of kyoto imperial university,was chosen the best one.
it's sung in the graduation,entrance and other ceremonies.
furthermore,takashi asahina,a graduate of kyoto university,chose this school song as his first album's music(teichiku entertainment inc.released.
kyoto university symphony orchestra performed).
you can see the lyrics on the kyoto university's official website.
when the centennial anniversary of foundation came around in 1997,the establishment of a new school song was planned,and its lyrics were sought,but the majority said the conventional one was better,so the plan was stopped.
there exist some other songs listed below related to kyoto university.

but the original words are partly different from the present ones.
lake biwa rowing song
the words were made by taro koguchi,a member of third high school aquatics club(today's boat club of kyoto university),while he was on the way of the lake biwa cruise in 1917.
the music diverts one from "hitsujigusa(by chiaki yoshida),which was popular with the club members at that time.
third high school's dormitory students and others liked to sing it.
university flag
the university flag was established in 1940 for the same purpose as the university song.
you can see its design on kyoto university's official website.
school color
kyoto university's school color is dark blue.
emblem
kyoto university's emblem is the design of a camphor tree,standing in front of the clock tower in yoshida campus.
this design had been used since around 1950s as the "seal of the administrative bureau" on printed materials and others,and in 1990,it was officially adopted as the university's emblem.
the situation of newly-enrolled students
out of 2,901 students newly-enrolled for faculties in 2008,those from high schools in the kinki district are the most at 57.5%(osaka prefecture 18.8%,hyogo prefecture 12.3%,and kyoto prefecture 10.4%),followed by the chubu district at 14.5%,kanto district at 8.7%,kyusyu&okinawa district at 6.7%,chugoku district at 6.5%,shikoku district at 3.3%,tohoku district at 1.4%,and hokkaido at 1.1%.(＝>please refer to the situation of newly enrolled students of the former imperial universities)
for other former imperial universities,students come the most from the prefecture the university is located in,but,for kyoto university only,those from high schools in kyoto prefecture rank the third peculiarly.

education
liberal arts
the education of kyoto university at the faculty stage can be roughly classified into two,liberal arts that are commonly lectured in all faculties,and major subjects at each faculty.
out of the two,the liberal arts were rearranged so as to center the common subjects in the curriculum,after the college of liberal arts and sciences was closed in 1993.
the way that assigns liberal arts and major subjects is not a mechanical one by the grade that assigns the liberal arts to freshmen and sophomores,and the major subjects to juniors and above,but a gradual one that requires students to take relatively many of the liberal arts in the first grade,and increases major subjects as the grade goes up so that students can take both of their credits until graduation.
however,in some faculties,students can never register the course nor enter the institute when they fail to take credits of certain liberal arts along the way(de facto enforcement of repeating the same grade).
liberal arts are mostly lectured in all faculties and are classified into five groups below.
group a:humanities and social sciences
group b:natural sciences
group c:foreign languages
including the japanese education for students from abroad
group d:health and physical education
group ex:credit exchangeable subjects in the consortium of universities in kyoto
note that some subjects belong to plural groups at the same time,such as group a and c,or group b and d,so students should choose in which group they learn those subjects when they register.
each faculty sets certain number of credits to be taken in each group.
some faculties don't accept certain subjects as credits that should be met for graduation.
for example,in group b,there is a course of mathematics for students majoring in humanities,but this course is unacceptable as credits for students majoring in science.
particularly,the faculty of engineering specifies the group b subjects as credits and doesn't accept other subjects at all.
in addition,among students of the faculty of integrated human studies,the very idea of group is not applied,except for group c.
and among those students who entered the faculty of letters in heisei 16 academic year and before,group a,b,and d were not distinguished.
besides,there are subjects mentioned below that are given credits of the groups,from a to d,according to their contents.
orientation seminar for freshmen(called "pocket semi")
this seminar started in 1998 academic year.
it aims to expand students' horizons by having them contact with different majors' teaching staff.
kyoto university international education program(kuinep)
lectures are given in english to japanese and foreign students alike,both of whom are almost the same in number.
the administration of liberal arts had been in the charge of the faculty of integrated human studies on and after the closure of the college of liberal arts and sciences,but since 2003,it has been in the charge of the newly established "institute for the promotion of excellence in higher education".
courses' registration and transmission of information,such as lecture cancellations,papers,and examinations,are all done on the website,so they use kyoto university's liberal arts syllabus information system(briefly called kulasis).
support programs adopted by the ministry of education,culture,sports,science and technology
support program for good practice as unique university education

facilities
university campuses
yoshida campus
this campus is sometimes called "yoshida areas".
it's divided by the road into seven areas,called "konai(campus)".
the name of each konai has begun to be used since 2000s,and so,teachers and students use the former popular names occasionally.
honbu konai
faculties using honbu konai:faculties of letters,education,law,economics,and engineering
graduate schools using honbu konai:graduate schools of letters,education,law,economics,engineering(division of physics),energy science,informatics,(a part of)asian and african area studies,biostudies(the office department,and some laboratories),hall of global environmental research,school of global environmental studies,government,graduate school of management
attached facilities using honbu konai:university library,institute of economics,the kyoto university museum,academic center for computing and media studies(north building),center for integrated area studies,center for archaeological operations,kokoro research center,and so on
access:on foot,it takes 10 minutes from demachiyanagi station of keihan oto line,or by kyoto city bus,you should get off at "kyodai seimon-mae" or "hyakumanben".
many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these two stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station(in kyoto prefecture),and imadegawa station.
it's also called "main campus".
this campus has been used since kyoto university's foundation.
before the university's foundation,there had been a suburban residence in kyoto belonging to owari-han clan.
the stone walls at that time still exist,facing higashi-oji,and the incident of ishigaki café happened here.
enter the main gate,and you will see just at the front the clock tower centennial hall and the camphor tree,both known as the symbol of kyoto university.
the university's two administrative organizations,administrative council,and education and research council,exist in this campus.
institute for research in humanities plans to move to the building no.5 of the faculty of engineering(formerly used by the department of global engineering,and the like)
hokubu konai
faculties using hokubu konai:faculties of science,and agriculture
graduate schools using hokubu konai:graduate schools of science,agriculture,and(a part of)biostudies
attached facilities using hokubu konai:institute for research of humanities,research institute for fundamental physics,research institute of mathematical sciences,research center for low temperature and materials sciences,the attached farm and botanical garden,and so on
access:on foot,it takes 15 minutes from demachiyanagi station of keihan oto line,or by kyoto city bus,you should get off at "kyodai nogakubumae" or "hyakumanben".
many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these two stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station,and imadegawa station.
it's also called "north campus".
science facilities mostly occupy this campus,and there are many graduate students here,so some people acquainted with kyoto university say, "the atmosphere of this campus is calm,compared to that of honbu konai or yoshida-minami konai."
in the faculty of agriculture's ground(commonly known as "no g"),located at the northeast corner,sports' club activities,such as those of the american football,are done.
ginkgo trees standing in line from the main gate of the faculty of science are well known to local residents.
yoshida-minami konai(yoshida-south campus)
faculty using yoshida-minami campus:faculty of integrated human studies
graduate school using yoshida-minami konai:graduate school of human and environmental studies
attached facilities using yoshida-minami konai:academic center for computing and media studies(south building),center for the promotion of excellence in higher education,and so on
access:on foot,it takes 15 minutes both from demachiyanagi station of keihan oto line and from marutamachi station of keihan line,or by kyoto city bus,you should get off at "kyodai shomon-mae" or "konoedori".
many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these two stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station,and imadegawa station.
this campus is sometimes called by its former name "sojin campus".
or more simply, "yoshida campus".
the common subjects are mostly lectured here,so freshmen of all faculties spend most of their time in this campus.
this might explain why bills and standing signboards,recruiting students to join the club or sending political messages,are noticeable here.
yoshida south campus academic center building(formerly,faculty of integrated human study's a building)stands at the place where the professor orita's statue once had existed in front,but the reconstruction of the building totally changed the atmosphere around here.
in its courtyard,there are two pine trees("nihonmatsu" in japanese),which are the origin of the place's name here.
the sports clubs do their activities in the ground or in the tennis court of this campus.
kyoto university's yoshida-ryo(dormitory)exists within the same premises.
in 2004,lawson opened its convenience store,the first one as the private company in the national university,at the basement of the yoshida south campus academic center building.
seibu konai(west campus)
faculty using seibu konai:none
graduate school using seibu konai:none

many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these two stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station,and imadegawa station.
there is no lecture room or laboratory,so this campus is used merely for sports classes or extracurricular activities.
there stands a building for clubs in front of west hall.
this building gets so old that its reconstruction is planned,but it's not materialized owing to the dispute between students and the university authorities over how to control the new building.
the ceremony of entrance,graduation,degree conferment,and others,are held at sports gymnasium.

many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these three stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station,and imadegawa station.
in yoshida campus,this is the last area that was enlarged for the university.
so it's used by relatively new institutes and other organizations.
some sports and music clubs do their activities here.
byoin konai(university hospital campus)
faculty using byoin konai:none
graduate school using byoin konai:none

many lines of kyoto city bus bring you to these two stops from other stops in kyoto city,such as kyoto station,kawaramachi station,and imadegawa station.
in general,there is no student here.
the university of the air sets its parabolic antenna at the higashioji street side of this campus.
trouble of congestion
in yoshida campus,especially in main and yoshida-south campus,many buildings stand side by side in small premises,so the path between the buildings is narrow and there is little space for parking.
that's why it's strictly restricted to drive a car into the campus and park it.
the running of a motorcycle within the campus is also regulated.
and so,many students go to school by bicycle,but again,they are annoyed with a chronic lack of the bicycle parking lot,and some of them put their bicycles outside of the lot,which become traffic obstacles in some cases.
and there is no end to minor collisions between a bicycle and a pedestrian.
disaster prevention
just outside of the east edge of the campus,hanaori fault runs along.
when this fault triggers the earthquake,its damage will be tremendous,so rapid seismic strengthening works of the buildings are under way.
relics
in yoshida campus,many relics of the past from the jomon to edo period have been found.
relics listed below are the major ones.
kitashirakawa-oiwakecho relics(jomon period):in north campus

in faculty of medicine campus
the former assembly room of the third high school:it was built in a.d.1911(meiji 44).
in yoshida-south campus
surroundings
mainly along imadegawadori street and higashioji street,old book stores,restaurants,cafes and the like stand,contributing to the atmosphere of the student town.
around the campus,there exist many things related to the teaching staff and students,such as, "tetsugaku no michi(path of philosophy)" related to kitaro nishida,the great philosopher and the professor of kyoto imperial university,and the monument in mt.yoshida inscribed with the words of "shoyo no uta(song of wandering kyoto)".
hyakumanben,used as the nickname of kyoto university in novels and others,originates from chion-ji temple(formally,daihonzan hyakumanben chion-ji temple),neighboring the campus.
uji campus
faculty using uji campus:none
graduate schools using uji campus:graduate school of engineering,agriculture,energy science,and informatics(not all,their partial departments)

access:on foot,it takes 5 minutes both from obaku station of jr nara line and from obaku station of keihan uji line.
the campus was founded in 1947,utilizing the site of the japanese army's powder magazine.
from 1950 to 1960 academic year,lectures had been given to freshmen of the college of liberal arts and sciences.
and now,there is no lecture of the faculty here.(but exceptionally,some intensive lectures are held in uji campus,which are commonly taught in all faculties during the summer vacation or other occasions.
for example, "a guide to beam science" is given to students by institute of chemical research.)
some laboratories' seniors in faculties of engineering,agriculture and others,do their studies for graduation in this campus.
katsura campus
faculty using katsura campus:none
graduate school using katsura campus:graduate school of engineering(divisions of electric,chemical,architectural and global engineering)
attached facility using katsura campus:international innovation center
access:keihan kyoto kotsu,yasaka group,and kyoto city bus(all bus lines)are available,and you should get off at the stop of "katsura innovation park-mae", "kyodai katsura campus",or "katsura goryozaka" of those bus lines.
about keihan kyoto kotsu,most buses start from katsura station of hankyu kyoto line,and about yasaka group and kyoto city bus,all buses start from mukomachi station of jr.
in 1990s,two campuses,yoshida and uji,became too cramped,so the construction of "the third campus" was planned.
initially,the southward of kyoto prefecture,and somewhere in shiga prefecture,were picked up as candidate sites,but kyoto city proposed "katsura goryozaka",which was developed as the residential area,so they selected this place in the end.
in 2003,divisions of chemical and electric engineering transferred here completely and began to utilize this campus.
the campus is divided into four "clusters" from a to d,and part of cluster c and d are still under construction as of 2006.
in addition,there exists a project that the tozai line,one of kyoto municipal subway lines,will extend its line to the place around katsura campus,but its date and other concrete agendas are undecided yet.
the transportation between the campuses
a shuttle bus for the students and teaching staff is available between the campuses.
the bus makes 6 round trips a day between yoshida(main campus)and uji(this line is commonly called "uji bus"),7 round trips a day between yoshida and katsura,and 3 round trips a day between uji and katsura respectively,and each trip needs around from 50 minutes to one hour.
but the students complain the traffic jam and others make it difficult to keep the punctual service,and that the last bus starts so early they have to use the public transportation after that.

especially,they have many kinds of parfaits that are rare in other university cafeterias.
"lune",the cafeteria near the west hall,serves parfaits as many as 16 kinds regularly,and including seasonal ones,it's checked to have about 40 kinds of parfaits for now.
