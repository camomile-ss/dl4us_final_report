masanori hojo
masanori hojo(1189-december 4,1204)was a busho(japanese military commander)in the early kamakura period.
his father was tokimasa hojo and his mother was maki no kata(lady maki),the second lawful wife of tokimasa.
his common name was totomi samanosuke(vice-minister of left division of bureau of horses).
his official court rank was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade).
since his mother was from kyoto,he went to kyoto as an envoy when minamoto no sanetomo,the third shogun,welcomed the daughter of nobukiyo bomon,a noble in kyoto,as his lawful wife.
however,he fell ill in kyoto and died as young as 16 years old.
judging from his high official court rank for a man of his age,it is considered that tokimasa's legitimate son was masanori whose mother,maki no kata,was from a noble family,rather than yoshitoki hojo who was masanori's older paternal half-brother.
the death of masanori who was favored by tokimasa and maki no kata triggered internal conflicts in the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)and in the hojo clan,which led to shigetada hatakeyama rebellion and makishi incident.
