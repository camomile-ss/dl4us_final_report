yasuaya wakisaka
yasuaya wakisaka was the tenth(last)lord of the tatsuno domain in harima province.
the twelfth head of the wakisaka family in the tatsuno domain.
he was born on january 1,1840 as the fourth son of takayuki todo,the eleventh lord of the tsu domain in ise province.
since toshinosuke(later yasuhiro wakisaka),the real son of yasuori wakisaka who was the ninth lord of the tatsuno domain,was young,yasuaya became the adopted son of yasuori in july 1858.
when yasuori retired on may 20,1862,he took over as head of the family and became the tenth lord of the domain.
since the wakisaka family was fudai daimyo(a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the tokugawa family),yasuaya took a position responsible for the security of coastal defense of the settsu province as a member of the sabaku-ha(supporters of the shogun),and joined the first and second conquest of choshu in 1864 and 1866,respectively,as a member of the edo bakufu army(the army of japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
however,it seems like he was passive about the conquest of choshu because he refused to actually join the troops at the second conquest on the grounds of yasuaya being ill.
he followed the order of the new government army at the boshin war in 1868,and joined the aizu war and the attack of the himeji domain which revolted against the new government.
in july 1869,yasuaya was appointed as the governor of tatsuno clan in accordance with the return of lands and people to the emperor and then worked on the reform of the ladder in the domain,but was dismissed from the office of the governor due to haihan-chiken(abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures)in august 1871.
in 1884,he was honored as viscount in accordance with the peerage law.
he died on february 27,1908.
died at the age of 70.
