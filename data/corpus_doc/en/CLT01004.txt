hatsuni(first cargo of the year)
hatsuni means shipping goods(products)from distribution bases including factories and warehouses to stores for the first time after the new year starts.
originally hatsuni took place on january 2 as well as the first sale of the year.
however,today the first cargo of the new year is generally shipped on january 4 when public offices and many companies open for business.
in the old days trucks ran with flags or long banners saying 'hatsuni' in carrying hatsuni.
but they have almost disappeared so far with consideration of the safety on the expressway and so on.
