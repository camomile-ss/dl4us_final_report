kanetomo kikuchi
kanetomo kikuchi(1383-april 5,1444)was a busho(japanese military commander),who lived from the period of the northern and southern courts to the early muromachi period.
he was the 18th family head of kikuchi clan.
he was a son of taketomo kikuchi,who was the 17th family head.
his official rank was higo no kami(governor of higo province).
he also had the title of sakyo no daibu(master of the eastern capital offices).
he inherited the family estate due to the death of his father in 1407 and became the family head.
he continued to have a defying attitude like his father toward the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)after the unification of southern and northern courts,and defeated morimi ouchi while allying with mitsusada shoni in 1431.
however,due to conflicting perspectives regarding a stance against muromachi bakufu and his partiality toward his second son tadachika kikuchi,he faced up to his son mochitomo kikuchi,was consequently stripped of the family estate,and was exiled to sashiki,ashikita county.
he passed away on april 5,1444 in despair.
