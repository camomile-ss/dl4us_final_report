yagyu domain
yagyu domain was the ruler of yagyu-go village,sonokami no kori county,yamato province(modern day yagyu district,nara city).
although,it was a small domain with the crop yields of 10,000 koku,the lords of the yagyu clan always carried weight as an instructor of swordplay in the shogun family for generations.
history of the domain
after munenori yagyu's death(the forefather of the domain),because the territory of 12,500 koku was divided into 8,300 koku for the well known mitsuyoshi yagyu(jubei)the first son,4,000 koku for munefuyu yagyu the third son and 2,000 koku for retsudo gisen,the yagyu clan became hatamoto(direct retainers of the bakufu,which is a form of japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)from daimyo(japanese feudal lord).
after mitsuyoshi's death,munefuyu became the successor to the yagyu clan and inherited the property(but returned 4,000 koku to bakufu).
in 1668,having another 1,700 koku added,yagyu clan returned to the position of daimyo with the 10,000 koku.
they established a government building of domain called yagyu jinya.
the lords normally stayed in edo for generations to act as an instructor of swordplay for the shogun family.
the yagyu clan was the ruler for the next 13 generations until the meiji period.
