yahei ozaki
yahei ozaki(years of birth and death unknown)was a member of the miburoshigumi(mibu masterless warriors group)which was the forerunner of the shinsengumi(literally,the newly selected corps,referring to a special police force for the tokugawa regime).
yahei joined the miburoshigumi in around june or july,1863,as his name appeared in a 'list of signers for official documents submitted to the shogunate' ('bakufu teishutsu josho shomeisha ichiran' in japanese)which was dated july 10,1863.
however,yahei's name was not included in a 'list of active-duty troops' which was created in august or september,1863.
this may be because yahei retired somewhere before then,but shinpachi nagakura's "doshi renmei ki" (literally,the "record of the fellow troops' names")included an alleged name of him,yahei ozeki,who may possibly be identical with yashiro ozeki.
if so(i.e.if yahei was identical with yashiro ozeki),he died of an illness on december 24,1865.
