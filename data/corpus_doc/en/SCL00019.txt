history
in 1900,ritsumeikan gakuen was originated in kyoto hosei gakko(kyoto school of law and politics),which was established by kojuro nakagawa,who was the secretary to kinmochi saionji.
the current school name, 'ritumeikan,' took over from the ritumeikan private school,which was opened by kinmochi saionji at the kyoto imperial palace in 1869.
origin of the school's name
the name 'ritsumeikan' was derived from 'jinshinsho,' a statement by mencius: "human life is decided by destiny,but while waiting for fate you must improve yourself."
because of that,the chinese government donated a statue of mencius that had been sculpted from white granite from shandong province,and announced at the opening ceremony of the ritsumeikan university confucius institute.
