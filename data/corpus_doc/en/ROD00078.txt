ryogaemachi-dori street
the ryogaemachi-dori street is a street running north-south through kyoto city.
it extends from marutamachi-dori street in north to sanjo-dori street in the south,running a block west of karasuma-dori street.
the suwancho-dori street runs along its southern extension.
origin and history
it did not exist in heiankyo and was built by hideyoshi toyotomi according to his tensho zoning policy.
a kinza(literally,gold za,or gold mint)was established by ieyasu tokugawa around the intersection with oshikoji-dori street in 1600 and a ginza(literally,silver za,or silver mint)was moved from fushimi to an area south of the kinza in 1608.
therefore many financial dealers and gold-and silver-smiths were concentrated along the street.
current status
because financial institutions were relocated to the area along karasuma-dori street,the current ryogaemachi-dori street is only a narrow downtown street.
suwancho-dori street
suwancho-dori street,located along the southern extension of the ryogaemachi-dori street,runs from takatsuji-dori street in the north to hanayacho-dori street at the northern end of higashihongan-ji temple in the south.
the name of the street comes from suwa-jinja shrine,which is near the intersection with matoba-dori street.
during the early edo period brothels were established in rokujo misujimachi around rokujo-dori street
