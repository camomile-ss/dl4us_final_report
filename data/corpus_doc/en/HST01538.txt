uin(council of the right)
the uin(council of the right)was an administrative body in the early meiji period.
it was established alongside the seiin(central state council)and the sain(council of the left)when the system of the daijokan(grand council of state)supervising the three councils was introduced in 1871.
it was abolished when the genroin(senate of japan)was established in 1875.
based on a reflection on the conflict of opinions between the ministries under the former system of the two councils and the six ministries,it was established as a body coordinating and adjusting ministerial policies.
it consisted of the kyo,the heads of the ministries,and the taifu,the vice-ministers.
its power was weaker than that of the seiin as its resolutions were recognized by the latter as matters to be decided.
the ministry of finance,whose power stood out of all the ministries,often caused the uin to malfunction.
