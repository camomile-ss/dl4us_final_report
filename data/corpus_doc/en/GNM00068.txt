history
yunohana-onsen is said to be a hot spring made from the tears of an oni which were closed by a numen of cherry stone,natural treasure,which was transformed into mica due to hydrothermal alteration of mineral called cordierite which was found here,and it is said that the custom to throw beans during setsubun(bean throwing night)was developed from the cherry stone.
the present-day yunohana-onsen was established through the rediscovery of the springhead through a survey conducted based on ancient documents that mentioned busho(japanese military commander)during the sengoku period visiting the hot spring to be cured.
john lennon and yoko ono,also visited here,and masayuki kakefu did training on his own at the hot springs when he was playing in the hanshin tigers.
