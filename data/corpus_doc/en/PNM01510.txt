after that,she became famous in kyoto and stormed the residence of taira no kiyomori who was a person of power in those days.
she was rejected once because another shirabyoshi,gio,was loved by kiyomori at the time,but after she showed her dance to kiyomori after an offer by gio,she began to be loved by kiyomori instantly.
