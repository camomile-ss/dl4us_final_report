kashiwagi's father,to no chujo(the first secretary's captain),who did not know behind-the-scene circumstances,thanked genji for his condolatory call and felt sadness again.

genji held kaoru,who bit the bamboo shoot with his new baby teeth,looked back on his life so far,and paid attention to kaoru's young,but noble countenance.
one autumn evening,yugiri(the tale of genji)visited kashiwagi's widow,ochiba no miya.
on his way home,ochiba no miya's mother,ichijo no miyasudokoro,sent yugiri the yokobue that kashiwagi left.
kashiwagi appeared in yugiri's dream that night,telling that there was somebody else whom he wanted to hand the yokobue to.
subsequently,yugiri,who visited genji,saw kashiwagi's face in kaoru,who was playing innocently with the children of young lady akashi.
then he told genji about kashiwagi's last words and the dream,but genji just said that he would take charge of the yokobue,and changed the subject.
