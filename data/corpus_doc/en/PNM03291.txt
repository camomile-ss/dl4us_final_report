fumi no hakase
fumi no hakase(date of birth and death unknown)was a person who lived in the asuka period.
fumi is of an immigrant descent whose family name was imiki.
his first name is also spelled as博勢.
he visited southern islands twice due to official duties.
it is said in the "nihonshoki" (chronicle of japan)that mukoni fumi no imiki hakase and shinkosan geosa no morota were sent to tane(tanegashima island)to explore the southern region on march 23,695.
it is said in the "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued)that mukoni fumi no imiki hakase and 8 others were dispatched to look for countries in the southern region on april 13,699.
the party received weapons before leaving.
on june 19 of the same year,people from southern islands,tane,yaku,amami and tokara,came over to japan with guides and offered various gifts
those places are now known as tanegashima island,yakushima island,amami-oshima island,and the tokara islands(some believe it is tokuno-shima island).
particulary for the people of tokara,this was the first time to visit to japan.
although the guides are believed to be someone from the party,fumi no hakase was not one of them.
hakase came back with osakabe no maki on november 4 and was offered a higher rank.
