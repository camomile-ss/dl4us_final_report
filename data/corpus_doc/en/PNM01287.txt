minamoto no akimasa's mother
minamoto no akimasa's mother(year of birth and death unknown)was a tanka(thirty-one syllables' poem)poet in the late heian period.
she was a concubine of udaijin(minister of the right)minamoto no akifusa.
she was a descendant of fujiwara no kanesuke of fujiwara no yoshikado line of the northern house of the fujiwara clan,and a daughter of shinano no kuni no kami(governor of shinano province)fujiwara no koretsuna.
her siblings included fujiwara no koresue,fujiwara no aritada,jinki(enryaku-ji temple),and keiko.
she was a nominated poet of chokusen wakashu(anthologies of japanese poetry compiled by imperial command)whose tanka poem appeared in "kinyo wakashu" (kinyo collection of japanese poems)(the second version,poem number:589)
she probably served imperial princess tokushi(wife of emperor horikawa)as a court lady.
she became a wife of minamoto no akifusa,and bore him children,such as minamoto no nobumasa,gon dainagon(provisional major counselor)minamoto no akimasa,and todai-ji gon shosozu(junior lesser prelate of todai-ji temple)kakuju.
(however,some disagree with the idea that she was the mother of nobumasa.)
on october 16,1107,she entered into priesthood on the same day as imperial princess tokushi did(from "chuyuki" (diary of fujiwara no munetada)).
