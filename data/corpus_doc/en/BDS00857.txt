donei eio
donei eio(1424-1504)was a priest of the soto sect in the muromachi period.
his secular surname was fujiwara.
his posthumous name was eio.
his dogo(a pseudonym as a priest)was donei.
he was from kyoto.
after studying zen buddhism of the rinzai sect at temples including engaku-ji temple and shokoku-ji temple,he switched to the soto sect and succeeded to the teachings of isshu shoi.
these days the soto sect is known for its mokusho zen(a method of zazen,a state of thinking nothing)teachings,however donei eio practiced kanwa zen(meditation supplemented with koan[small presentations of the nature of ultimate reality,usually presented as a paradox])and is recognized as its originator.
he held prominent positions at famous temples including sorin-ji temple and saijo-ji temple and established rinsen-ji temple and chonen-ji temple.
he was appointed chief priest of eihei-ji temple at the recommendation of taian sueki and iso chushin.
at the time eihei-ji temple was in decline and there were expectations that donei eio would be able to revitalize it,and he worked hard at doing so however his term was short-lived.
therefore,he is not officially counted among the chief priests of eihei-ji temple.
