moriyamajuku
moriyamajuku is the 67th post station on the nakasen-do road(＝>the 69 stations of nakasen-do road)and is located in moriyama city,shiga prefecture.
summary
the area was named 'moriyamajuku' by edict in 1642,in the early part of the edo period.
the name 'moriyama' derives from the construction of 'tomon-in' gate that served as the eastern gate of enryaku-ji temple on mt.hiei.
in other words,the station was to serve as defense for mt.hiei.
for travellers,moriyamajuku became widely known and thrives as the first stopover point on the route from kyoto heading toward east,recognized by the saying, 'kyo-dachi,moriyama-domari(leave kyoto and sleep over in moriyama).'
it later merged with yoshimi to its east and with imajuku to its west and developed further.
