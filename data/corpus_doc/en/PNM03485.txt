inugami no mitasuki
inugami no mitasuki(his age of birth and death are unknown)was from the asuka period.
he was a diplomat.
according to "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters)and "nihonshoki" (chronicle of japan),the inugami clan was the descendants of inayoriwake no miko who was a son of yamato takeru no mikoto;they were a powerful family that had the base in inugami-no-kori county of omi province where many immigrants from china and korea had settled;the members of the inugami clan were often involved in the diplomacy related to such foreign countries,so some historian says that they were one of the clans originated from a immigrant such as amenohiboko.
in 614,mitasuki became one of the last kenzuishi(japanese envoys to sui dynasty china)as well as yatabe no miyatsuko and went to sui;in 615,they came home bringing the envoy of baekje(or paekche).
in 618,sui dynasty came to the end and tang dynasty began;in 630,japanese emperor jomei decided to send the first envoy to tang(the envoys have been called kentoshi)by the advice of kusushi no enichi,and appointed mitasuki as a member.
the first kentoshi had been in tang for two years,and in 632,they came home bringing the tang's envoy gao biaoren,a learning priest min and others.
at this occasion,the diplomatic relations with tang dynasty began.
in shiga prefecture remains the passport used by inugami no mitasuki during he was a kentoshi and it is regarded as the oldest passport in the world.
