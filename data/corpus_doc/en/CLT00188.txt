opinions on origin
there are two opinions:one is the yoshida family origin,that the yoshida family produced 125 works of ancient shinto music and dancing that became the origin of naniwa kagura-dance,and the other is the fushimi inari-jinja shrine origin,that 16 forms out of 25 works of gosho kagura-dance handed down to the shrine are in common with naniwa kagura-dancing and thus became an origin of naniwa kagura-dance.
