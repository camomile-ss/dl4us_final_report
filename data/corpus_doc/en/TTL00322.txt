shi(government post)
shi was a collective name of daishi and shoshi established in jingikan and daijokan(benkankyoku)under the japanese ritsuryo legal code system.
shi corresponds to sakan,the fourth rank of shitokan.
the corresponding court rank of daishi of jingikan was junior sixth rank,senior eighth rank and that of shoshi of jingikan was junior sixth rank,junior eighth rank,whereas that of daishi of daijokan was senior sixth rank,upper grade and that of shoshi of daijokan was junior sixth rank,senior seventh rank,both of which were higher than those of jingikan.
the prescribed number for jingikan was one for each of daishi and shoshi(two in total),and that for daijokan was two for each of daishi and shoshi for each of sabenkankyoku and ubenkankyoku(eight in total.)
the officials who were in charge of writing were traditionally called 'fuhito',and the kabane of shi was sometimes conferred on the chinese and korean clans settled in japan who held the post of shi.
in the ritsuryo legal code system,the duties of shi were recording and creating official documents under the command of a senior official,examining the official documents,reading proofs and asking for instructions from the senior official.
shi of daijokan were also called hachishi,meaning eight shi,because they belonged to benkankyoku headed by benkan,which was divided into sabenkankyoku and ubenkankyoku,in each of which there were two for each of sadaishi,udaishi,sashoshi,and ushoshi,i.e.,eight shi in total.
later,when daishi in benkankyoku were raised to fifth rank(taifu),they were especially called taifushi(or shitaifu.)
after otsuki no tomochika was appointed sadaishi corresponding to fifth rank,the otsuki clan(the mibu family,the omiya family)served as daishi joseki,which was kanmu,for generations,being in charge of keeping the transmission of records and documents of daijokan under the name of 'kanmu family.'
