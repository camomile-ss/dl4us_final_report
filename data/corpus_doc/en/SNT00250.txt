hono
hono is a religious act performed by ujiko(shrine parishioners)and danka(supporters of a buddhist temple)aimed at respecting or appeasing and pleasing shinto and buddhist deities in which people offer 'something of value' to such deities(including tombs).
therefore,the offerings used in hono are not always 'materials' such as food,liquor,money or valuable items.
rather,in general, 'activities' such as kagura(sacred music and dancing performed at shrines),yokyoku(noh song),dance,martial arts or parades with dashi(floats)or mikoshi(portable shrine)are offered in many cases.
the ancient customs of sacrifice and 'hitobashira' (the practice of burying people alive under pillars of buildings to ensure protection),although cruel,could also be regarded as a form of hono.
tablets such as ema(wooden plaques on which people write their prayers and wishes)or sangaku(wooden plaques containing geometrical puzzles)are also occasionally offered as hono.
