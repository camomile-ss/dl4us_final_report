tankei
tankei(1173-june 20,1256)was a sculptor of buddhist statues during the kamakura period..
all the sons of unkei became sculptors,of which the oldest son,tankei,is known as a virtuoso like unkei and kaikei.
it is known that,at the age of 82,tankei completed a big statue of the senju kannon(the thousand armed kannon),the principal image at the myoho-in temple,rengeo-in(sanjusangen-do)in kyoto according to the inscription on the monument.
among the 1,000 statues(more precisely 1,001 statues)standing together in large numbers on either side of the principal image at sanjusangen-do,some statues have an inscription saying the statue was made by tankei.
