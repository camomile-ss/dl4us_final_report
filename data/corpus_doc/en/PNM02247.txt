although he went up to kyoto as a member of roshi-gumi gobantai(no.5 troop),he returned to edo with hachiro kiyokawa and other member,because of division of roshi-gumi after their going up to kyoto.
in the same year,roshi-gumi was reorganized into shinchogumi after returning to edo,and tamaki was selected for one of the teacher of swordsmanship.
in boshin war,shinchogumi fought together with samurai of the shonai clan,however,after defeat in the war,members of shinchogumi including tamaki were recruited for cultivation under poor condition.
