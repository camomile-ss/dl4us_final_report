heiroku
heiroku is one of japanese yokai(ghosts,spirits and monsters)that was portrayed in sekien toriyama's yokai art collection book: "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (the bag of one hundred random demons;the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki,replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough,most of the yokais shown in this book are tsukumogami[a type of japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]).
it is portrayed as a strange yokai brandishing a gohei(wooden shinto ritual wand with a pair of white zigzag paper streamers),and it is regarded as a tsukumogami.
since sekien did not leave any description on the heiroku in the book,details are unknown.
according to some researchers including shigeru mizuki,yokai cartoonist, 'heiroku is a yokai which brandishes a kotobure paper(a piece of paper with a handwritten message),claiming it an oracle,and spreads false rumors to confuse people.'
kenji murakami,a yokai investigator,has insisted that the heiroku should be modeled on a red ogre-like yokai that holds the gohei which is depicted in "hyakki yagyo emaki" (a night parade of one hundred demons' picture scroll)of the muromachi period.
