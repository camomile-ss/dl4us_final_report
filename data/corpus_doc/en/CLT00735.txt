tegara
tegara is a hairdressing cloth to wrap around the topknot of traditional japanese women's hairstyles.
it was once also called "magekake".
the materials are mostly crepe,brocade for higher-class samurais,and in the meiji period a new material appeared which was made with japanese paper.
although there were no particular rules,young women and wives often wore tegaras with kanokoshibori(a kind of tie-dyeing)in bright colors like red and pink,and older women wore plain tegaras in calm colors like soft lilac and light blue.
