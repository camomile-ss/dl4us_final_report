nobutsuna kutsuki
nobutsuna kutsuki(1582-june 16,1662)was a busho(japanese military commander)from the azuchi-momoyama period to the early edo period.
he was the child of mototsuna kutsuki.
his official rank was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade),hyobu-shoyu(junior assistant minister of the hyobusho ministry of military).
his pseudonym was ryusai.
he married magdalena(christian name),takayoshi kyogoku's daughter,but she died early on april 27,1606.
his children were tomotsuna kutsuki,yoshitsuna kutsuki,mototsuna kutsuki(same name as his father),and his daughters became yoshitada oshima's wife,kaikyu okamoto's wife,soji kawaguchi's wife,and dokaku korai's wife.
he served the toyotomi clan first and the tokugawa clan second.
he served as haizenyaku(a person for tray service)at the ritual for ieyasu tokugawa's appointment of daijo-daijin(grand minister of state)in 1616.
he served as one of the hatamoto(direct retainers)with 6,470 koku(approximately 1.16 million liters of crop yield)under the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
even though he was a hatamoto,he had shoryo in a key place for defense and was originally from the distinguished family of omi-genji(minamoto clan),so he was ranked with kotaiyoriai(alternate yoriai,a family status of samurai warriors in the edo period),which was treated equally to daimyo(japanese feudal lord).
however,since his brother tanetsuna kutsuki(the lord of the tsuchiura domain)was appointed as daimyo,his status as soke(the head family or house)was weakened.
also,takamichi kyogoku(the lord of mineyama domain,tango province),one of his sons who used his wife's surname kyogoku,was adopted by takatomo kyogoku and became a daimyo of tanba-mineyama with 13,000 koku(approximately 2.34 million liters of crop yield).
he died in kutsuki in the omi province on june 16,1662 as he was caught in the omi-yamashiro earthquake.
he died at the age of 81 and his hogo(a buddhist name)was sugen.
