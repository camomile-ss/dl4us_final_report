katsuragawa rest area
the katsuragawa rest area,located at kuze-higashi-tsuchikawa town in minami ward(kyoto city)kyoto prefecture,is a stop on the meishin expressway.
it was the only rest area operated by the road service organization,an incorporated foundation,before the privatization of the japan highway public corporation.
in march 1998,lane widening next to the sakurai parking area at shimamoto town,mishima-gun(osaka prefecture)(between the oyamazaki junction/oyamazaki interchange and the takatsuki bus stop)forced its service to be discontinued,but subsequently the facilities were purchased and rebuilt.
the site of the old sakurai rest area has been used for the takatsuki second junction.
the katsura river,from which its name originates,is located just a kilometer from the rest area.
