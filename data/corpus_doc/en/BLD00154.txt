summary
when constructed in 1898 as the chapel of heian jogakuin st.agnes school,it was called "sei-san-ichi daiseido" (literally a sacred three-one cathedral),but st agnes church was organized in 1923 by persons related to heian jogakuin st.agnes school and now,st agnes church is called a cathedral.
the gothic style brick building was designed by james mcdonald gardiner,the first schoolmaster of st.paul's school.
in the daily records of the school,immediately after the completion of building the cathedral,it was written; 'the school was instructed by the police to change the crest on the tower because it might be confused with a chrysanthemum.'
the kyoto campus of heian jogakuin st.agnes school,where the church is located,is in the former nijo-jo castle where yoshiaki ashikaga resided,and a stone monument where the description of 'the former nijo-jo castle site' is inscribed is placed at a corner of the school premises.
