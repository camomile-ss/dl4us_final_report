since the oka family's original family name was kono,hakku let josai use the original family name.
he learned how to read and write around the age of 4 or 5,made chinese poetry at the age of 10;he was called a prodigy.
his first strain of learning was commentaries of the ancients like his father hakku oka,but later he changed it to neo-confucianism.
since he was great in neo-confucianism,he served hasunoike domain of bizen province.
