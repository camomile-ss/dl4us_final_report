history
shoden-ji temple is believed to have originated with a temple founded in 1268 by gottan funei,a disciple of togan ean,in karasuma imadegawa before being relocated to its current site in 1282 with the assistance of tsunehisa mori of kamo-sha shrine,then the temple became prosperous.
the temple received the devotion of the imperial family and shogun families during the muromachi period but fell into decline as a result of a fire that started during the onin war(1467-1477).
it was restored with the help of hideyoshi toyotomi and ieyasu tokugawa,and possessed five sub-temples during the edo period.
the dry landscape garden in front of the main hall is attributed to enshu kobori.
