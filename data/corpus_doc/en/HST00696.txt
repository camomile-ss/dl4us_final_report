mimaki domain
mimaki domain is a domain which was in mimaki,kuse county,yamashiro province(present-day kumiyama-cho,kuse-gun,kyoto prefecture).
summary
the head family of the domain was the tsuda family.
nobunari tsuda was related to nobunaga oda's family,and after the death of nobunaga,he served hideyoshi toyotomi and possessed a territory worth 13,000 koku(crop yields).
although after hideyoshi died,he had been serving hideyori toyotomi,he made advances to ieyasu tokugawa just before the battle of sekigahara and joined the eastern army.
as he successfully fought in the battle,his territory was approved and he was permitted to continue his family line.
ieyasu,however,accused nobunari tsuda of the incident which,in 1607,he and michishige inaba from the shimizu domain of mino province,visited gion in kyoto and committed an outrage,sexually abusing seventy-eight beautiful women including the female proprietor of the tea house.
as a result,he was punished by being deprived of his fief,and the mimaki domain became extinct.
