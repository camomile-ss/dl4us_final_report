jitsugokyo
jitsugokyo was a textbook used for elementary education from the end of the heian period to the early meiji period in which precepts for ordinary people were mainly compiled.
summary
in the preface of "kagakushu" (compiled in 1444),it was listed,along with "dojikyo," as one of the top textbooks for children's education.
in view of the fact that this book was compiled in "zushoryo text ruiju myogisho" (compiled in 1103 at the latest),it is considered that the book was written earlier than the above.
as it appears in volume eight of the nagato printing "heike monogatari" and "zotanshu" written by muju,this book was already in circulation in the kamakura period.
though the author is unknown,it is presumed,judging from its content,that the book was written by a member of the buddhist order.
during the edo period,this book was used as a child's book on calligraphy as well as moral training at terakoya(temple elementary school).
