koromonotana-dori street
the koromonotana-dori street is a street running north-south through kyoto city.
it extends from kamo kaido on the right bank of the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)in the north to rokkaku-dori street in the south.
it was divided between shimei-dori street and a side of genbu park-200 meters south of shimei-dori street-and between ichijo-dori street and kamichojamachi-dori street.
north of ichijo-dori street,there are several sections that deviate east or west.
it did not exist in heiankyo and was built by hideyoshi toyotomi according to his tensho zoning policy.
during the edo period there were many kimono fabric shops along the street,much like muromachi-dori street running a block east,which became the origin for the name of the street.
today,however,fewer dealers are along the street compared with muromachi-dori street.
