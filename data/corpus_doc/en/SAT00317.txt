it is believed that the deities enshrined behind the top of mt.ebumi(present-day mt.konpira)were divided and transferred to the new shrine built at the foot of the mountain.
the enshrined deity is ujigami(a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the shinto religion)for大原八ヶ町.
originally,it was enshrined together with bishamon-do江文寺temple.
