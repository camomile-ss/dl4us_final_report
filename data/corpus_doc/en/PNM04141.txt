personal history
in 1615,he was born as the third son of narifusa arao.
he was adopted to the wada family in omi when masanobu wada died in 1616,and took over as head of the family.
he was appointed chief retainer of tadao ikeda at a young age and at the time of relocation of the tottori domain in 1632,he went to tottori earlier than others and took care of various tasks such as inspection of the land and residential areas.
although he was regarded as a promising talented young man,he was suddenly attacked by a disease on his way to edo and died in kyoto in april 1642.
he was 28 years old and his posthumous buddhist name was tenkoin.
because he and his wife,a daughter of sanehisa tokudaiji,did not have biological children,they adopted the second son of takanari arao,tadanobu wada,as their successor.
there are divergent accounts on his at death,including the genealogical table in the "inpuroku" (the history of tottori prefecture),which put it as 21,and 'arao narifumi kafu' (the genealogical table of narifumi arao),which put it as 42.
in this column,his age at death is based on the "inpunenpyo" (chronological table of tottori)and the records of deputy of chief retainer from "tottori-han shi" (history record of tottori domain).
