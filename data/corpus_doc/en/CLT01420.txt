eritategoromo
an eritate-goromo(literally,standing-collar robe)is one of japanese yokai(ghosts,spirits and monsters)that was portrayed in sekien toriyama's yokai art collection book: "gazu hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (the illustrated bag of one hundred random demons;the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki,replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough,most of the yokais shown in this book are tsukumogami[a type of japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]).
summary
sojobo of mt.kurama(also called kurama tengu),one of the eight greatest japanese tengu(long-nosed goblins),used to wear a clerical robe with a standing collar,which reportedly transmuted into a yokai and was thus named the eritate-goromo.
in toriyama's book,the buddhist priest's robe worn by sojobo has eyes and a beard on it,and its sharp collar forms the eritate-goromo's nose.
the sojobo of mt.kurama used to be a human high priest.
according to a legend,sojobo mistakenly believed that he suddenly realized buddhahood in the middle of ascetic practices,thereby failing to become buddha after death.
according to one view,he was reincarnated as tengu,which is a synonym for arrogance.
although he became a tengu,he still wore the priest's robe as if he persisted in the dignity as a priest.
the robe may be a proof of his arrogance.
it is supposedly either sojo's fatal arrogance or the possession by an evil spirit that caused the robe to turn into a yokai:the eritate-goromo.
