ryuson
ryuson(706-june 9,760)was a priest in the nara period.
ryuson learned the doctrines of hosso(faxiang)and kegon(avatamsaka;flower garland)under gien,and he first lived in gango-ji temple,then moved to kofuku-ji temple.
he proposed imperial prince toneri to invite some chinese priests who could formally hand down the precepts and sent yoei and fusho to tang in 733,which presumably led to the coming of dosen and jianzhen to japan.
ryuson was appointed risshi(the second highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the third highest rank in the hierarchy of buddhist priests)in 751,and on the occasion of the ceremony to consecrate the great buddha at todai-ji temple in 752,he acted as kegon lecturer,but he resigned the position of risshi in 755.
