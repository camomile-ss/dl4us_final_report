fujiwara no uchimaro
fujiwara no uchimaro(756-december 24,812)was a court noble,who lived from the nara period to the early heian period.
he was the third son of fujiwara no matate of the northern house of the fujiwara clan.
he was also known as gonagaoka-no-daijin(minister gonagaoka).
he took over from fujiwara no nagate,his uncle,as the main line of the northern house and,unlike his father,who was from a branch family and therefore unable to become a minister,he reached the rank of udaijin(minister of the right),which is one rank higher than that of his father,serving as the head of the government from the early days of emperor heizei's reign to the beginning of the reign of emperor saga.
he was also blessed with many offspring and laid the foundation for the future prosperity of the fujiwara clan.
