ugajin
"ugajin" is a folk religion god(shinto)worshipped since the medieval period in japan.
the shinmei(name of god)is believed to have derived from ukano-mitama appearing in japanese mythology(some say it derived from 'ugaya,' which is a buddhist word meaning 'zaise' (the giving of wealth),but they are a minority),and it was originally a god worshipped among the people as god of spirit of grains and god of good fortune,similar to ukanomitama-no-kami.
this was adopted in the education and learning of enryaku-ji temple on mt.hiei(tendai sect),and syncretized with benzaiten(sarasvati,buddhist goddess of music,learning,eloquence,wealth,longevity,and protection from natural disasters),a god of buddhism.
thus,it is also referred to as uga-benzaiten.
worshipping of uga-benzaiten spread nationwide centered around chikubushima island,omi province(hogon-ji temple),close to enryaku-ji temple,and itsukushima-jinja shrine in aki province,enoshima-jinja shrine in sagami province,etc.
these became shrines enshrining ichikishima-hime and other gods during the separation of buddhism and shintoism in the meiji period.
at ugafuku-jinja shrine in kamakura city,ugajin remains enshrined as a shinto god.
many people in the tochigi region today live with under the ugajin family name.
