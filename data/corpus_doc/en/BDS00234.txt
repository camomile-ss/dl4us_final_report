he studied under shinbutsu,a disciple of shinran who was a founder of jodo shinshu,and later became shinran's direct disciple and changed his name to kenchi.
he always went with and followed shinran and attended on him when he came back to kyoto.
in 1258,after shinbutsu died,he succeeded the third senju-ji temple,shinshu sect takada school head temple and helped kakushinni and devoted himself to build otani-byodo mausoleum.
