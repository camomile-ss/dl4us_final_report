he founded a private school,and started teaching the creed of suika shinto,which respects the legitimate reason,to young court nobles,but because of this,he was deemed as the central figure of the 'horeki incident' in 1758 and condemned to the most severe punishment in banishment,and he was expelled from kyoto.
