he was highly estimated to be a 'talented person' by his father,suketsune,and was promoted up to be a jusani(junior third rank),however,he was not favored by government posts,including the fact that he was not appointed to be a kurodo(chamberlain),nor a benkan(official of the dajokan),both of which were regarded as conditions of a family head of the kanjuji line,in addition to being the 4th son,he ended in a hisangi(advisor at large).
further,he was differentiated by his nephew toshisada bojo,who was known as a capable official,and tsunetada nakamikado in promotion,and when he competed with toshisada for territory in 1284,he lost the lawsuit,although he had received a support of the kanpaku(chief adviser to the emperor),kanehira takatsukasa.
in the same year,he became a priest and passed the family estate over to his son,nobufusa.
the madenokoji family has come to be highly prosperous in future generations,endowed with capable offspring.
