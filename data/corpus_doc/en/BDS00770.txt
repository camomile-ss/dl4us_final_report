shumon aratame-yaku(an officer in charge of the persecution of christians)
shumon aratame-yaku is one of law enforcement posts set up in the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)and in all the domains.
shumon aratame-yaku took charge of cracking down on christians--christianity was banned--and supervised policing.
it is said that the post was firstly set up when masashige inoue,ometsuke(chief inspector of the edo shogunate),was appointed as shumon aratame-yaku in 1640,and the post was also assumed by sakuji bugyo(commissioners of building)from 1662.
in 1664,the edo bakufu ordered all the domains to establish shumon aratame-yaku in their domains.
in the bakufu,the post of shumon aratame-yaku was assumed jointly by one ometsuke and one sakuji bugyo,but this was abolished in 1792.
