shigoto-osame means to carry out the last business of a year near the end of december,i.e.the end of the year.
it is stipulated in the law concerning holidays of government administration offices(december 13,1988,law no.91)that the period between and including december 29 and january 3 is holidays for the japanese government and municipal agencies,and that december 28 is designated as the last business day for the year or goyo-osame(another expression of shigoto-osame).
