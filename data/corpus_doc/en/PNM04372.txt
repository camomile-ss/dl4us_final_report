his younger brother,sanetomi succeeded to the sanjo family.
at the beginning,sanetomi who succeeded to the sanjo family decided to make kinkyo,his older brother kimmutsu's son,succeed to the sanjo family,however,kinkyo was a person of loose morals,therefore,sanetomi disinherited kinkyo and made his biological child kinyoshi sanjo(三条公美)succeed to the sanjo family.
