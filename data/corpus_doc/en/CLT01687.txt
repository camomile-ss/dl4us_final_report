comment
danjuro the seventh,after selecting kabuki juhachi ban,died in the middle of selecting shin kabuki juhachi ban covering roles for which he had gained a reputation,and so his fifth son,danjuro the ninth,completed the selection around 1887.
danjuro the ninth maintained the name 'shin kabuki juhachi ban,' which had been given by his father,danjuro the seventh,but the selection contained more than eighteen programs,and in the end he selected thirty-two or forty programs based on an interpretation of 'juhachi ban' not as '18 programs' but as 'ohako,one's favorite stunt.'
the selection contained many programs of katsurekimono,proposed by danjuro the ninth himself,and many programs are seldom performed today.
