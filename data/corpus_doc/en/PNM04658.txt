at this time,iwayu was granted setto(a sword given by the emperor in the symbol of his trust to the appointment of someone to a mission),and after this,granting setto in the subjection of indigenous inhabitants in eastern japan became a custom.
this subjection was conducted for five months,from march to august by soldiers in kanto and hokuriku.
after the subjection,iwayu and others were granted reward grants directly by the emperor.
due to this subjection,they succeeded in establishing control over the whole area of northern echigo(ideha gun(ideha district),echigo province),and its three years later,in 712,dewa province was established.
