his childhood name was choshomaru.
at the age of 7,he became a lord of murata fort and owned shibata and katta counties with a total stipend of 30,000-koku crop yield.
since it is believed that he saved people by asking the heaven with heart and soul to calm the eruption of zao mountain range in 1623,he is still called legendary wise ruler in murata village(present-day murata-cho,shibata-gun,miyagi prefecture).
after he was conferred an official rank,he suffered from smallpox and died at yobo-ji temple at nijo,kyoto,being away from home.
at that time,10 of his vassals followed to the grave.
after munetaka's death,the murata date family became extinct because of no inheritor.

in murata-cho, 'munetaka-ko matsuri hanabitaikai' (lord munetaka commemorative fireworks display)is held on the anniversary of his death even now.
