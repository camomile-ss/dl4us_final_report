unzusho
unzusho is a book on rites that was written in the late heian period.
the title of the book literally means 'an instruction for rites of unjo(in other words,seiryoden or the imperial court).'
it illustrates the arrangements of rites in seiryoden with colored pictures.
the author was identified as fujiwara no tomotaka in "honchoshojaku mokuroku" (the oldest list of japanese books in existence written during the kamakura period).
however,in modern times,since hidematsu wada presumed that the author had been his elder brother,fujiwara no shigetaka,and that the year of compilation had been the late 1110's,this presumption has been widely accepted.
nevertheless,during the edo period,toshimasa bojo,who was a descendant of fujiwara no tametaka,advanced a new theory that fujiwara no chikataka,who was a younger brother of aforementioned shigetaka and tomotaka,was the author.
since fujiwara no tametaka was a real brother of shigetaka,tomotaka and chikataka,there was a possibility that the history of the book had been handed down in the bojo family,but the truth remains unclear.
