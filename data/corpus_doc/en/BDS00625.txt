zenjodo
zenjodo is the mountain path that leads to zencho(the peak of a sacred mountain).
the ascetic deeds performed on a sacred mountain,such as mt.fuji,mt.tateyama or mt.hakusan,are called zenjo.
since the nara period,high or beautiful mountains in japan have been the object of a mountain religion,so some people began to implement their ascetic deeds on mountains;subsequently,these deeds developed into shugendo(japanese mountain asceticism and shamanism incorporating shinto and buddhist concepts).
