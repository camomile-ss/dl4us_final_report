station layout
it is an aboveground station with two side platforms serving two tracks,allowing the inbound train and outbound train to pass each other.
because both the starting signal and the home signal are set up for only one direction,the train on the other line cannot be given priority to enter the station.
the station building is located on the kamo-bound platform side and connected to the kameyama-bound platform by an unroofed bridge.
as a quasi-sub-contracted railway station,it is unmanned early in the morning and from evening onwards.
there is no automatic ticket machine.
*the platforms are not numbered.
