emperor kotoku.
emperor kotoku(596-november 24,654)was the thirty-sixth emperor of japan(reign:july 12,645-november 24,654).
his imina(personal name)was prince karu.
his japanese-style posthumous name was ameyorozutoyohi no sumeramikoto.
during his reign there was a court in naniwa-no-miya(naniwa palace),and thus later the period of his reign including its policies(known later as the taika reforms)and such were sometimes referred to as naniwa-cho(naniwa court).
biography
he was the eldest son of oshisaka no hikohito no oenomiko chinu no okim,and emperor bidatsu's grandson.
his mother was called kibitsuhime okimi.
emperor kogyoku(emperor saimei)was his elder maternal half-sister,and emperor tenchi(naka no oe no oji)was his nephew.
he made emperor kogyoku's daughter hashihito no himemiko his empress.
he married abe no kurahashimaro's daughter otarashihime,and fathered prince arima.
he married soganokura-yamada no ishikawamaro's daughter chinoiratsume.
according to "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan),the emperor was a stout buddhist and looked lightly upon the shinto religion.
he was calm and collected,liked confucian scholars and often granted imperial clemency irrespective of the subject's social standing.
isshi-no-hen(the murder in the year of isshi)occurred in june 645,and emperor kogyoku tried to pass on the throne to naka no oe no oji on june 14.
naka no oe no oji refused it and recommended prince karu instead.
prince karu refused the throne three times and recommended furuhito no oe no miko,but furuhito no oe no miko refused it and became a priest.
on june 14 prince karu stepped onto the stage and assumed the throne.
he gave emperor kogyoku the title sumemioya no mikoto and made naka no oe no oji the crown prince.
he made abe no uchimaro(abe no kurahashimaro)sadaijin(minister of the left)and soga no ishikawa no maro udaijin(minister of the right).
he made nakatomi no kamako(fujiwara no kamatari)uchitsuomi(an important governmental post presiding over important state affairs while assisting the emperor).
he made somin and takamuku no kuromaro kunihakase(teachers of japanese classical literature).
he was the first to establish gengo(an era name),designating 645 as the first year of taika,and in 650 changed the gengo to hakuchi in 650.
according to "nihonshoki," emperor kotoku implemented system reforms in various fields from 645 through the following year.
these reforms came to be called the taika reforms by later scholars.
among kaishin no mikotonori's(the imperial reform edict)four articles which the chronicles cited regarding these reforms,the first and the fourth are known to have been altered based on the government regulations of later generations.
for this reason,some claim that the major reforms which the chronicles described had not occurred at this time,and this has become an extremely controversial point regarding the history of japan,referred to as the taika reform dispute.
during the reign of emperor kotoku,envoys often visited from goguryeo,baekje and silla(the three kingdoms of korea).
hostages were sent not only from baekje as in the past,but also from silla which was on the defensive in the korean peninsula.
japan(wa in those days)abolished the survey of mimana which had become a mere fa√ßade.
an envoy with accompanied by many personnel was sent to tang(china).
josaku(stockades)called nutari no ki and iwafune no ki were built in koshi province to defend against the northern emishi people,manned by sakuko(immigrants from the kanto and hokuriku regions who were forced to work for the government).
this is the first appearance of josaku(an official defense site)and sakuko in historical documents.
emperor kotoku built naniwa no nagara no toyosaki no miya palace(chuo ward,osaka city[osaka city])and designated the city as the capital of japan.
however in 653,the crown prince asked the emperor to move to the city in yamato.
when the emperor refused,the crown prince moved to the city in yamato with empress kogyoku,his empress and his younger brother(emperor tenmu).
most of vassals left following the prince.
the emperor was disappointed with this and the next year fell sick and passed away.
nowadays,some historians claim that prince karu was the 'mastermind' who abetted naka no oe no oji to cause 'isshi no hen.'
however,prince karu gave important posts to many local ruling families of the soga clan after he ascended the throne,which is sure to invite debate in future years.
