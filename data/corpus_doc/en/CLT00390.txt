name
these kind of cakes began to be sold near the kanda(chiyoda ward)of edo, 'imagawa-bashi bridge' during 1772 and 1780 in the mid-edo period,and the name of imagawa-yaki originates from this time.
since these cakes became very popular,the product name,imagawa-yaki was adopted around the country(it is not related to the imagawa clan,a sengoku daimyo(japanese territorial lord in the sengoku period).
the name,imagawa-yaki is not used nationwide and different names are used in various areas.
sometimes a certain name is only used in a certain area,or it may be called a different name by different people.
particularly in western japan,this sweet is often called by different names.

if the filling is hard and stiff like bean paste,the filling can be filled evenly if it is twisted as is put into the cake mold.
an imagawa-yaki pan is slanted in order to be able to turn over imagawa-yaki easily.
it is difficult to make imagawa-yaki which are all of the same thickness.
