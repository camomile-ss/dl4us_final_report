kimosui(eel liver soup)
kimosui is a clear soup containing the guts of eel as a main ingredient.
the "kimo" in kimosui means literally liver,but actually it's a region of the guts generally composed of the stomach and other parts of adhesive organs,such as the kidneys and bowels.
kimosui is usually a clear soup "sumashi-jiru",without miso(soybean paste)or other murky sauces but with such ingredients as fu(bread-like pieces of wheat gluten).
these guts are considered to be suited for clear soup,since they contain less fat than the part used for kabayaki(broiled eel).
