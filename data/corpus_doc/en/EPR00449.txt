toyosukiiribime no mikoto
toyosukiiribime no mikoto(year of birth and death unknown)was a member of the imperial family,who is said to have lived in the kofun period(tumulus period)according to "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters)and "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan).
she was saigu(imperial princess appointed to serve the deities of the ise-jingu shrine).
in the nihonshoki,her name was written as豊鍬入姫命or豊耜入姫命,while in the kojiki,it was written as豊鉏入日売命.
she was the imperial princess of emperor suijin,and her mother was a daughter of kinokuni no miyatsuko arakawatobe,named totsuayumemaaguwashi-hime.
her elder half brother by the same mother was toyokiiribiko no mikoto,and her half brothers by different mothers were emperor suinin and yasakairibiko no mikoto.
in the sixth year of emperor suijin's rein(92 b.c.),she dedicated herself to enshrine amaterasu omikami(the sun goddess)at kasanuinomura village by the imperial order of her father.
afterwards,she continued running its rites and festival until yamato hime no mikoto took over the charge on the tenth day of the third month of 25th year of emperor suinin's reign(old lunar calendar)(5 b.c.).
according to a myth,hokenoyama tomb(sakurai city,nara prefecture)is her tomb.
there is a theory that identifies toyosukiiribime no mikoto as toyo who governed yamatai-koku kingdom.
