ganri-mon gate
ganri-mon gate was one of the 19 gates of the buraku-in(reception compound)of the daidairi(greater imperial palace).
summary
it is a hisashimon(gate with a canopy)located in the north gallery of enei-do hall.
some illustrations depict the north gallery of enei-do hall as a tsuiji(a mud wall covered with a roof)but these are simplified illustrations that were created later.
there was originally north gallery which was connected to the south gallery of kantoku-do hall,and ganri-mon gate located in between these.
there are also illustrations in which the gate on the north gallery is depicted as kaimei-mon gate but these are also incorrect.
