fujiwara no moroyasu
fujiwara no moroyasu(year of birth and death unknown)was a person from the mid-heian period.
his father was fujiwara no tadahira.
his mother is believed to be minamoto no shoshi(the daughter of minamoto no yoshiari)due to moroyasu's name being similar to fujiwara no morosuke,fujiwara no morouji,and fujiwara no morotada,but this is unclear.
since there is mention of 'the third one not being of respectable character' within the section of the "eiga monogatari" (tale of glory)that introduces tadahira's children,it is presumed that moroyasu was tadahira's third son.
tadahira's second son,morosuke,was born on january 16,909,and his fourth son,morouji,was born around february 20,913,and moroyasu is believed to have been born on august 19,910 since there is record of a birth of a child in tadahira's diary("teishinko-ki")on that day.
there is,however,a possibility that this child mentioned in the diary could not officially be recognized in the genealogy records,such as the "sonpi bunmyaku" (a book compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy),and as such,moroyasu date of birth remains unknown.
there is mentioning in the "sonpi bunmyaku" of moroyasu 'being a jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and entering into priesthood,' but there is no detailed record of his career,such as the year of death.
based on what was mentioned in the previously mentioned "eiga monogatari",he may have had his coming-of-age ceremony and may have received a joshaku(peerage)(i.e.if he was born in 910,and had his coming-of-ceremony at 15 or 16,he must have received peerage in 924 or 925),but seeing that he could not get any positions within the court,he may have entered priesthood right away.
