his younger brothers were akinobu kitabatake and akiyoshi kitabatake..
his son was akinari kitabatake(who later became known as morokiyo murakami and was the founder of the murakami-suigun navy).
the kitabatake family was a branch family of the murakami-genji(minamoto clan.)
biography
his father,chikafusa was a 'sambo(one of three omniscients with fusa(æˆ¿)character in their name),' served the emperor godaigo in later years,and assisted the 1333 kenmu restoration.
akiie became jusanmi(junior third rank)mutsu no kami.
in the next year,1334,in accordance with an order from imperial prince norinaga(the son of emperor godaigo;later to be known as emperor gomurakami),he went to tagajo castle(tagajo city,miyagi prefecture)in mutsu province with his father and began management of the tohoku region.
in the same year,he assumed the junii(junior second rank),and in 1335,he was appointed as shogun of chinjufu.
in the same year,while takauji ashikaga's army rebelled against the kenmu government in kamakura and approached kyoto,akiie brought the oshu army to kyoto in pursuit of ashikaga's army in december(old lunar calender).
they were able to defeat and expel them from kyo with the help of yoshisada nitta and masashige kusunoki.
in january of the following year,1336,he defeated takauji in settsu province,while he was attempting to go to kyoto again.
takauji later departed for kyushu.
in march,he assumed a vice councilor of state,and returned to oshu again to destroy asikaga's army who rose in revolt.
in 1337,taga castle was captured by the ashikaga clan;however,he escaped disaster at that time because akiie had transferred the kokufu to ryozen(soma city and date city,fukushima prefecture).
in may 1338,moving west again,he fought a battle with the ashikaga clan,and captured kamakura as ordered by imperial prince yorinaga.
while,he won a victory from the ashikaga side in the battle of aonogahara in mino province(ogaki city,gifu prefecture),he abandoned his kyo campaign due to dwindling force numbers and sheer exhaustion,and departed for ise.
later,despite advancing on iga,he lost battles because his soldiers' strength was sapped and they incurred injuries sustained in the constant battles with oshu.
again,seeking to revive his campaign he raised an army in sakaiura and ishizu in izumi province.
however,due to a delay in the expected arrival of his reinforcements,his army could not match ko no moronao's army and they were routed.
later,he still fought battles having two hundred soldiers,including attendants,but was killed in battle(the battle of ishizu.)
he was 21 years old.
before his death,he wrote an address(akiie's kanso--akiie's advice to the emperor)to godaigo to convince him of the failure of the kenmu restoration.
there is a memorial tower constructed in a place along the ishizu-gawa river in nishi ward,sakai city,where akiie was supposedly killed in battle.
his grave is in kitabatake koen park in abeno ward,osaka city.
also,abeno-jinja shrine in abeno ward enshrines akiie kitabatake..
furthermore,ryozen-jinja shrine was built in ryozen where akiie constructed mutsu-kokufu;it enshrines akiie and his child.
incidentally,he is also famous for having used the fu-rin-ka-zan(as fast as the wind,as quiet as the forest,as daring as fire,and as immovable as the mountain)banner prior to shingen takeda.
