ojo(princess)
ojo is the title given to a daughter of a king or its equivalent monarch.
it is also used for female members of a royal family in general as a translation of the english word princess.
for example,the correct term for the daughters of the prince of the principality of monaco are either kojo or hime(both meaning princess),but they are generally called ojo as well.
although ojo that appear in animated cartoons are also called hime,such use is inappropriate because the title of hime is also used for daughters of daimyo(japanese feudal lord),the rank of which is lower than ojo.
imperial princess
a daughter of an emperor is called imperial princess.
