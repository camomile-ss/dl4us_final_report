history
1925
kyoto racecourse started operation on december 1.
1969
stables were moved from the racecourse to the newly constructed ritto training center.
1990
the pocket of the second corner was extended by about 200 meters.
the turf course of 1,800 meters(outer course)and 1,600 meters(inner course)came into use from the third race meeting(corresponded to the fourth meeting in usual years).
1994
the heian cavalry started to use the kyoto racecourse as the base of its activities(until 1997).
the renovation of the stand(later became big swan)as well as the alteration of the racecourse were completed.
1995
the horse races of seventh and eighth day of the first race meeting,which were scheduled on january 21 and 22,were cancelled due to the great hanshin-awaji earthquake.
nikkei shinshun hai(nikkei new year cup)was postponed to january 28(the first day of the second meeting).
the horse races of seventh and eighth day of the first race meeting,which were cancelled previously,were held on june 3(hankyu hai)and june 4(takarazuka kinen)as rehabilitation racing.
as the hanshin racecourse was damaged,eight race meetings(64 days)were held in the year.
1996
on february 10,the fifth day of the second race meeting,10r and 11r were held using the dirt track because of an accumulation of snow.
on the same day,9r violet stakes was conducted under the condition where the position of horses couldn't be confirmed,due to a snow storm that began immediately before the start,until they came to a point about 200 meters before the goal.
1999
the new stand named big swan was completed.
2001
on january 7,the third day of first race meeting,10r to 12r were cancelled due to snow.
special races were postponed to the following week.
on january 20,the seventh day of the first race meeting,6r and subsequent races were cancelled due to heavy snow.
these races were held on january 22 after selling betting tickets once again.
2007
large-sized turf vision,and so on were installed.
2008
on february 3,the second day of the second race meeting,steeplechase was cancelled due to fallen snow.
also,the starting time of 1r was put off by an hour and 5r and 7r were held on the dirt course instead of turf course.
on february 9,the third day of the second race meeting,3r and subsequent races were cancelled because it started to snow after the finish of 2r.

2009
the construction work of the no.2 gate was completed and it came into use on february 28 when park-winz(an event to use the racecourse as an off-course betting shop for the races held at other racecourses)was held.
it was named 'station gate.'
also,no.1 gate was named 'shinzan gate.'
courses
there are two turf courses,the inner course and the outer course.
yodo no saka' (yodo slope)situated at the third corner of the outer course is famous for 3.9 meters of difference in height.
horses running the tenno sho(spring)and the kikuka sho(autumn)surmount this slope twice.
these days,many jockeys use a spurt on the downward slope from the third corner to the fourth corner since the straight is even.
the radius of the curve from the third to the fourth corner of the outer turf course changes from 109.0 meters to 376.0 meters,to 456.0 meters,then to 100.0 meters.
other characteristics of the course are the angular corners and the false straight(similar to the false strait of hippodrome de longchamp)situated between the corners(though tokyo racecourse and hanshin racecourse have similar characteristics,theirs are not so extreme as those of kyoto racecourse).
thanks to the above characteristics,the so-called 'makuri' (a kind of jockey's technique)is effective since the loss of distance is relatively small even though a jokey takes the outer route.
besides,the fourth corner is the most angular one among the turf courses of the jra racecourses,and the inside part of the course is interrupted by confluence with the inner turf course.
since many jockeys use a spurt taking advantage of the downward slope,a scene where a herd of horses is broken is often seen.
the course for steeplechase splits into two at the point between the backstretch and the third corner.
on the course for grand steeplechase,there exist a big hedge of 1.5-meter-high and 2.9-meter-wide(except for a water jump,this is the widest one used for jra's jumping over steeplechase)and a banquette of 80-centimeter-high and 15.9-meter-wide.
(banquette:a stand for jumping up and jumping down,also called 'the triple jump' or 'big swan,' but the latter is seldom used after the same name was adopted as the nickname for the addition of the stand)
summary of the course
turf course:the length of the inner course is 1,782.8 meters and that of the straight is 328.4 meters.
the length of the outer course is 1,894.3 meters and that of the straight is 403.7 meters.

displays and others
following the tokyo racecourse,kyoto racecourse announced that it would replace its turf vision,which are set on the side of goal(no.1 device)and on the side of fourth corner(no.2 device),with the ones equipped with high-definition displays and multiple displays(only no.1 device).
aiming to complete it in time for the october 2007 race,the installation work continued for about ten months at the cost of 2,280 million yen.
the contractor was toshiba lighting and technology corporation.
a sneak preview was held on october 1 and new devices were put into operation on october 6.
the outdoor display set at paddock was also replaced.
(this one was manufactured by mitsubishi electronic corporation)
the size of turf vision at the goal side is 691.2 square meters,10.8 meters by 64.0 meters,and is three times the size of the previous one.
its size exceeds 'botokun' of suminoe boat race course,and it is one of the world's largest turf visions with multiple displays next to the one at the tokyo racecourse.
as the distance from the screen to the stand is shorter than that of the tokyo racecourse,jra is advertizing as "world's most exciting."
spectators can enjoy digital high-definition images and obtain a variety of information provided by a maximum of three screens.
hong man choi,a korean k-1 fighter,was used for the memorial poster of its completion.
a catchphrase 'tate 5 hong man choi,yoko 29 hong man choi' (5 hon man choi in height,29 hon man choi in width)was used for this poster.
also,a unit named 'turf bijon' (literally,beauties of turf vision)was organized aiming to create more appeal for the new turf vision.
the members were reiko okabe,kyoko fujikawa,and nana rokusha.
smoking corners were set up and three automatic telling machines(atm)came into operation on september 29.
