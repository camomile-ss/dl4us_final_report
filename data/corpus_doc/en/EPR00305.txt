prince iwakuranomiya tadanari
prince iwakuranomiya tadanari(1221-april 23,1279)was a member of the imperial family in the kamakura period.
the sister-uterine
cloistered imperial prince sonkaku,tendai-zasu(head priest of the tendai sect)and cloistered imperial prince kakue,chori(chief priest)of onjo-ji temple were his uterine brothers,and emperor chukyo and imperial prince yoshimune were half brothers by the same father.
he had male children:minamoto no hikohito and prince hikotoyo.
because emperor shijo had died on february 10,1242 at the age of only 12,a crown prince hadn't yet been selected,so the choice of a successor took considerable time.
prince tadanari was one candidate for the successor to the throne,and emperor gosaga,a prince of emperor tsuchimikado,was another.
prince tadanari,supported by his relative,michiie kujo,and prince kunihito(emperor gosaga)supported by sadamichi tsuchimikado,made separate approaches to the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
disapproving of prince tadanari's enthronement because he was the prince of emperor juntoku,yasutoki hojo,the shogunal regent of the kamakura bakufu,while insinuating military intervention at times,recommended as the successor,prince kunihito,the grandchild of emperor gotoba,claiming it was the divine will of tsurugaoka hachiman-gu shrine.
prince kunihito(emperor gosaga)ascended to the throne in april 19,1242.
after the coming-of-age ceremony in april 9,1249,the prince tadanari was called iwakuranomiya.
