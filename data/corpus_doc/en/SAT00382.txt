ama gozan
ama gozan is a jikaku(statues of a buddhist temple)of the rinzai sect introduced to nunnery temples,and modeled after the gozan system(the selection system of temples of the five highest ranks)in the muromachi period.
it is called ama-dera gozan.
like the kyoto gozan temples and kamakura gozan temples,five temples were each specified both in kyoto and in kamakura.
the chief nuns were often produced by imperial family,sekkan-ke(the families which produced regents),other court nobles and ashikaga shogun family(in kamakura,kamakura kubo(shogunate)family instead of it).
although gonen-ji temple,danrin-ji temple and tokei-ji temple continued without nuns by chief priests(men)instead or by conversion due to their decline after onin war,all the other temples were closed.
