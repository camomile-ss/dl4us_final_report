cultural property
national treasure
there are three main shrine buildings.
three identical buildings stand in a row.
the year 1320 is inscribed on the first shrine's ridgepole,so the other two shrines are also assumed to have been built in 1320.
all three buildings are built in kasuga-zukuri style(a style of shrine architecture employed in main sanctuaries,which has the same basic form as that of the kasuga taisha shrine).
they are the oldest of all sumigiiri kasuga-zukuri style buildings with confirmed dates of construction.
