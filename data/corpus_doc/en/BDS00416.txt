history
the temple was founded by nisshin in 1436 at the corner of higashinotoin-dori street and ayanokoji-dori street.
it once evacuated to sakai city avoiding the tenmon hokke disturbance,and then returned to kyoto to be reconstructed at the corner of ichijo-dori street and horikawa-dori street.
in 1587 following the order from hideyoshi toyotomi,it moved to the present location.
the temple possesses the pictures painted by tohaku hasegawa in the azuchi-momoyama period and their related materials.
it is the head temple of the shinshi hoen(scholastic faction of nichiren sect).
presently nichigyo otsuka kanju(the honorific title of the head priest)serves as the eighty-eighth head priest of the temple.
