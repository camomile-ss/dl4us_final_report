he was insightlful in reading people's physiognomy,and when he learned that fujiwara no akinobu,fujiwara no michinaga's third son,wished to marry his daughter,he declined the proposal on the ground that akinobu had the physiognomy of entering the priesthood(his daughter married yoshinobu,akinobu's younger brother).
since akinobu entered the priesthood as he had predicted,he was praised for his accuracy in judging people in "okagami" (the great mirror).
