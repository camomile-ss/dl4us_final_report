taira no koreyoshi
taira no koreyoshi was a busho(japanese military commander)who lived during the mid-heian period.
he belonged to the sect of taira no kunika of the kanmu-heishi(taira clan).
he was the son of taira no kanetada,assistant governor of kazusa province,but there is no description about him in "sonpi bunmyaku" (bloodlines of noble and base).
in 1003,he was hunted down by fujiwara no nobukaze,oryoshi(suppressor),for burning down shimousa province and rooting the goods paid as taxes or tithes and he fled to echigo province.
in 1014,in the section of february 7 in "shoyuki" (the diary of fujiwara no sanesuke),it is written that he presented 20 horses and other luxurious items to fujiwara no michinaga in order to be reappointed as chinju-fu shogun of mutsu province and onlookers were crowded in front of his house to see this incident,so it means that he had been chinju-fu shogun before this.
mr.minoru noguchi argues in 'taira no koreshige and taira no koreyoshi' in "a research on togoku samurai in the medieval period" that he is the one and same as taira no koreshige,the yogo shogun who appears in episode 4 'taira no koreshige gets killed by a retainer' and episode 5 'taira no koreshige slew fujiwara no moroto' of volume 25 of "konjaku monogatari shu" (tales of times now and then collection).
