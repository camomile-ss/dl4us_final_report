shomu
shomu meant management of territory(trial and collection of nengu[main land tax levied on the peasants based on the estimated productivity of land]and sozei[single land tax or combined land tax].)
it also meant the income from management(shomu shiki).
it originally meant job and duty as the chinese character所務literally means(where a person works),an example of which was shown in "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued);and in the heian period,as shoen koryo sei(the system of public lands and private estates)developed,it came to mean the management of private estates and public lands and rights and obligations involved.
the income from management and rights and obligations involved therein was established as shomu shiki in the structure of offices,and as azukaridokoro(a deputy of "shoen" manor lord)often did shomu,it was also called azukaridokoro shiki(the right that azukaridokoro-a deputy of shoen manor lord-had.)
later,the meaning was changed to the management of profits from the entire territory.
according to "nippo jisho" (vocabvlario da lingoa de iapam[japanese-portuguese dictionary],published 1603-1604), 'shomu was to collect nengu.'
further in the edo period,whole assets other than land is also called shomu.
