akabozu in kyoto prefecture
akabozu was described in an essay written by norimitsu yanagihara, "kanso jigo" (a monologue in the quiet life).
when a young man called lord sukeki hino(first rank)enjoyed talking with his friends over sake till late at night,something lightened suddenly behind a folding screen and there was a sign of a person.
when he looked at the back of the screen,a red monk stood in a fire and disappeared while they watched him with suspicion.
it was unidentified,but it was said as a sign of good fortune in home.
a researcher of specters,katsumi tada,said that it was a specter similar to zashiki warashi(a child ghost which is supposed to bring good fortune to the house or building it appears in)which is famous as a specter in the tohoku region.
