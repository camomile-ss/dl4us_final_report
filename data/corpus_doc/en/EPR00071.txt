due to this,the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)had to chose the successive emperor from emperor gotoba's line who lost the jokyu disturbance in 1221.
the regent,yasutoki hojo let prince kunihito(emperor gosaga),who was emperor tsuchimikado's prince,succeed to the throne after getting rid of emperor juntoku's prince,prince tadanari(emperor chukyo's half younger brother),who was recommended by the court nobles of michiie kujo,and others,and there was an interregnum of eleven days.
