oribe-yaki(oribe ware)
oribe ware is pottery made mainly in mino province from the tensho era(1573-1592)of the momoyama period.
the origin of the name
it was named after oribe furuta,who was a daimyo(feudal lord)and master of the tea ceremony and had been a disciple of sen no rikyu,because oribe ware was born under his direction and many chaki(tea utensils)of eccentric,novel shapes and patterns according to oribe's taste(oribe-gonomi)were produced.
characteristics
colors
there are several kinds of oribe ware according to glaze color and so on,including ao-oribe(partially covered with green glaze),aka-oribe(combination of red and white clay),kuro-oribe(a type of oribe ware with black glaze)and shino-oribe(a type of oribe ware utilizing techniques of e-shino).
the ao-oribe with green glaze decoration is the most famous one.
shape and pattern
while other chaki are expected to be well-ordered and decent in shape and also are valued for their abstraction,oribe ware include a number of representational articles,such as irregularly-shaped kutsukake chawan(tea bowls shaped like a shoe of old times),those with a checkered or geometric-pattern hand painting,and in later years,tableware and incense burners in the shape of a sensu(folding fan)and the like.
production techniques
mass production was also enabled by using climbing kilns and the method of pressing clay onto a wooden pattern covered with wet hemp cloth.
