inaba sodo(inaba riot)
the inaba riot was a large scale uprising of peasants which broke out in the nishiowari region(133 villages of inazawa,bisai,ichinomiya and tsushima[today's aichi prefecture in japan])in january 1870.
it is called the 'inaba riot' because it started at the inaba post station of minoji.
the riot lasted for 4 days and more than 30,000 people participated.
however,it was suppressed by gunfire from owari domain soldiers including some from the peasant army.
the domain side used a cannon and inflicted a large number of peasant casualties.
this is said to have ushered in the peasant revolt against the land-tax reform which is famous with the haiku meaning 'poke 2.5%tax cut with bamboo lances.'
details are written in page 597 of the 'shinshu inazawashi-shi honbun-hen i' (new edition of the history of inazawa city,text i).
