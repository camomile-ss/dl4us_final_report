a gozoku(powerful group)called the makishima clan was deeply rooted there,building a castle.
it was makishima-jo castle.
in 1573,yoshiaki ashikaga on the government side took up arms against nobunaga oda,and took refuge in makishima-jo castle counting on akimitsu makishima who was a bakufu bugyoshu(group of magistrates).
nobunaga entered kyoto immediately,and sieged the castle,forcing yoshiaki to surrender(the battle of makishima-jo castle).
after that,yoshiaki was forced to retire to wakae-jo castle in kawachi province,and the ashikaga bukufu both in name and reality perished.
after yoshiaki left,naomasa harada and yoshihiro ido became the masters of the castle,but after fushimi-jo castle was constructed,its strategic value diminished,causing the castle to be abolished.
