the yorimasa-zuka tumulus
built on a small hill in present day nishi-tsutsujigaoka-cho,kameoka city,the yorimasa-zuka tumulus is the kubizuka(tomb of the head)of minamoto no yorimasa of the tada-genji(minamoto clan),who died an untimely death towards the end of the heian period.
it is said that the body of yorimasa who died in a battle at uji was not buried here,because the tanba yada-go village was of all his territories the nearest to uji.
however,it is unclear whether this is correct or not.
it is said that in the edo period,a local priest doubted its existence,excavated the tumulus,and found a stone coffin there.
now,tsutsujigaoka elementary school,kameoka city is located adjacent to the tumulus.
there is a yorimasa-zuka crossing on national route 9 in joboji,shino-cho,kameoka city,and a yorimasa-zuka bus stop where keihan kyoto kotsu buses stop.
