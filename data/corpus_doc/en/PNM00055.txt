biography
renouncing the cloth to join the onin war
he was born on february 11,1439 as the tenth son of the sixth shogun,yoshinori ashikaga.
first he became a priest of jodoin temple of the tendai sect(sakyo ward,kyoto city).
in 1464 he renounced the cloth as requested by his older brother yoshimasa,who had no son,called himself yoshimi and became his brother's successor.
he was promised to become the next shogun with the kanrei katsumoto hosokawa(the shogunal deputy of the kanto region)as his guardian,and he took the younger blood-sister of yoshimasa's official wife tomiko hino as his official wife.
he was called imadegawa dono because he lived in the imadegawa residence.
however,when yoshihisa ashikaga,yoshimasa's biological son,was born to yoshimasa and tomiko in 1465,tomiko desired the succession of yoshihisa to the shogunate and she began to oppose yoshimi.
in september the bunsho political change occurred and caused the yoshimasa faction to lose its position,when it was rumored that yoshimi was contemplating a coup d'Ã©tat;however,yoshimi pleaded his innocence to katsumoto,and sadachika ise,who was the husband of yoshihisa's wet nurse,was tried for slander.
in 1467 the onin war erupted in connection with the problems concerning the succession to the headship of the ashikaga shogun family as well as the succession to the headships of the hatakeyama and shiba families.
yoshimi first belonged to the eastern force led by katsumoto,but in september,when masahiro ouchi of suo province went to kyoto,he fled to the isshiki and kitabatake families of ise province.
in 1468 he came back to kyoto from ise,persuaded by yoshimasa,but he escaped from the muromachi tei(palace)because he was opposed to yoshimasa,and instead he supported the western force of sozen yamana(mochitoyo yamana),making every effort to win the feudal lords of shikoku and kyusyu over to his side.
he made peace with yoshimasa in 1475,given that sozen yamana and katsumoto hosokawa had both died in 1473.
however,he fled to shigenori toki of mino because it was difficult to solve the differences between him and his older brother yoshimasa.
restoration to a leading figure
after yoshihisa ashikaga died in 1489,yoshimi went to kyoto with his son yoshiki and entered tsugen-ji temple on kyoto sanjyo.
there he became a priest with the title of dozon.
in fact,yoshimi began to seek reconciliation with his older brother and his brother's wife in about 1487,and he let yoshimasa adopt his son yoshiki,making him the successor of yoshihisa,who had no natural successor.
in fact,this year yoshiki was conferred jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and appointed to samanokami(minister of the horse office of the left).
after his older brother yoshimasa died of a disease on february 5,1490,yoshimi supported his son yoshiki as the tenth shogun on july 31,in collusion with tomiko hino,and he himself dominated the shogunal politics as the father of the shogun.
however,there was no way he could get along with tomiko hino,who had been so opposed to him in the onin war,and yoshimi gradually became opposed to tomiko,destroying the ogawadai manor(tomiko's residence)and seizing her territory.
therefore,tomiko approached the kanryo,masamoto hosokawa,who felt hostile to the succession of yoshiki,and because yoshimi decided that a confrontation with masamoto was not to his advantage he proposed holding the ceremony of the emperor's declaration of yoshiki as the shogun at masamoto's residence(however,masamoto quit the position of kanryo the day after yoshiki was declared shogun).
his last days
curiously,on february 24,1491,when he was in a dispute with masamoto hosokawa and in a disadvantageous situation,he died;it was exactly one year after the death of his older brother,yoshimasa.
he was 53 years old.
