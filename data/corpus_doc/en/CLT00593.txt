okuribi(ceremonial bonfire to send out spirits of the dead)
"okuribi" is one of the events observed in bon festivals to usher out from this mortal world to the other world those spirits of the dead that had once returned to their old homes during the bon period.
its antonym is "mukaebi" (ceremonial bonfire to welcome spirits of the dead that return to their old homes during the bon period);for more information please refer to the article on "obon."
its scale differs variously ranging from a small fire in front of the door step of each house or in its garden to a large scale bonfire prepared as an event of the local community.
okuribi of large scale is classified into two categories,okuribi on mountain sides or okuribi at seashores.
okuribi is said to have established itself as an annual event after the muromachi period when buddhism became widespread among the common people.
famous bonfires on mountain sides are gozan okuribi(bonfires on five mountains)in kyoto and takamado-yama daimonji okuribi(bonfires on the mt.takamado)in nara.
as for bonfires at seashores,festivals of 'toro-nagashi' (flowing of lanterns down a river)are practiced nationwide in japan.
this event is called 'shoryo nagashi' (floating lanterns carrying the spirits of the dead)depending on localities.
the origin and implication of the term "okuribi" as well as the contents and times of the events differ by regions where they are used and observed..
some of them seem to have recently started as tourist attractions.
