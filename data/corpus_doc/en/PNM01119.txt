saneaki ichijo
saneaki ichijo,as known as saneaki shimizudani,(?-june 11,1420)was a kugyo(top court official)in the muromachi period.
he is practically considered as the founder of the shimizudani family.
his father was gon chunagon(a provisional vice-councilor of state)kimimasa ichijo.
in 1408,he was promoted to shoshiinoge(senior fourth rank,lower grade)and became sangi(councillor)from ukone no chujo(middle captain of the right division of inner palace guards).
in the following year he also served as kokushi(provincial governor)of tosa province(till 1413).
he became jusanmi(junior third rank)in 1410 and shosanmi(senior third rank)next year.
in 1414 he also served as gon no kami(provisional governor)of bizen province,
he resigned concurrent posts and became junii(junior second rank)gon chunagon in the following year.
he resigned as gon chunagon in 1419.
in the following year,although he became gon dainagon(provisional chief councilor of state),he died in the same year.
when the shimizudani family,also a branch family of the saionji family,ended,saneaki inherited the territory and temporarily used the family name,shimizudani.
saneaki's son,kintomo shimizudani used the family name, 'shimizudani,' once used by his father,to differentiate from a sekkan-ke(the families which produced regents)of the same family name;therefore,his descendant was called shimizudani family.
kintomo's son sanehisa shimizudani was promoted to gon dainagon;however,his adopted son kinmatsu shimizudani who was from the hashimoto family died young.
hence,it was the end of the shimizudani family.
the family was restored during the edo period.
