takaragaike station
takaragaike station,located in the sakyo ward of kyoto city,is a stop on the eizan main line and the kurama line of the eizan-dentetsu(eizan electric railway).
station layout
it is an unmanned station with one island platform and two separate platforms serving four tracks.
a level crossing in the station(class 1 ko)lies in the south side(on the demachiyanagi side)of the platforms and interconnects the platforms,where many people and bicycles cross due to the station being unmanned and having no ticket gate.
there is a free bicycle parking area to the west of the level crossing,which was installed by the eizan electric railway.
a roof is installed on each of the platforms around the center,and platform 2 and 3 are equipped with a waiting room,where currently no bench but only a vending machine is installed,and the entrance door has been removed.
there is a slight slope from the entrance on the national route side on the west up to the kurama-bound platform 4,which is wheelchair-accessible.
caretakers are needed to go up and down the track level of the crossing and the platform level in order to access other platforms.
since the station is an unmanned transfer station,passengers are required to notify one of the train personnel regarding any transfer when leaving the train.
if a passenger has a ticket to his/her destination,it must be shown to the train personnel.
if a passenger gets on a train at an unmanned station and does not have a ticket to his/her destination,the passenger will be required to pay the fare to the destination on the train in transferring in order to have a ticket to the destination issued.
when using a kansai thru pass,the fare to the takaragaike station is deducted first and then the difference is deducted at the destination.
there is a single crossover leading to a kurama-bound outbound track on the hachimanmae side of platform 3.
there used to be shuttle trains bound for iwakura,which arrived at and departed from platform 3 once in the morning,but the operation was abolished in about 2000.
the operation of a special train running between demachiyanagi and takaragaike during the citizen's marathon was halted after the kyoto municipal subway was extended to kokusaikaikan,so now there is no shuttle train arriving at and departing from this station except when there is a problem.
the side track extending from platform 3 and 4 in the direction of shugakuin used to be a diverging double track,and the track extending from platform 3 used to cross the track leading from the outbound eizan main line to the kurama line at grade.
when a positive train control(ptc)was implemented,the track was changed so that it would diverge from the current platform 4.
station surroundings
the station faces national route 367,and to the south of the station and over the railway tracks lies an elevated bridge of shirakawa-dori street,which diverges from the national route.
the area around the station except along the national route comprises small residential areas between the station and the mountains.
kokusaikaikan station on the karasuma line of the kyoto municipal subway is located about 1 km northwest of the station.
