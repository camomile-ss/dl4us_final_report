shimei-dori street
shimei-dori street is a street running east-west through the north part of kita ward,kyoto city.
it runs west and slightly toward the north from kamo kaido and turns south to connect to horikawa-dori street.
there is little traffic because of the short extension.
originally it was a part of a route for the lake biwa canal,now filled,which went through horikawa from keage to matsugasaki via shimogamo,and under the kamo-gawa river using a siphon.
like horikawa-dori and gojo-dori street,its width is wide due to firefighting facilities which were installed to support forced evacuation during world war ii.
at present,the water park which uses water divided from lake biwa canal is under construction.
the plan is to divert water to horikawa,thereby reviving it.
public transportation
a kyoto city bus line exists between kamo kaido and karasuma-dori street.
