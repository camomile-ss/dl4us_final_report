most of them are supervised by jinja-honcho(the association of shinto shrines).
since shrine shinto has no scriptures,saishi are performed as per shinto writings such as "kojiki" (the record of ancient matters)and "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan).
saishi are performed by shinto priests.
jinja-honcho awards qualifications to people who have completed the designated training.
origin of the term 'shrine shinto'
the term 'shrine shinto' is relatively new.
it was created to distinguish shrine shinto from sect shinto after the meiji period.
between the meiji period and the end of world war ii,shrine shinto was protected by the government because 'it was not a religion.'
from somewhere around the end of meiji,it was called state shinto.
furthermore,influential scholars developed the theory of national shinto and divided it into 'kokutai shinto' (national structure shinto)and 'shrine shinto.
before world war ii,shrine shinto signified rituals,thought and organization in shrines that were brought under government control with the arrival of the modern age.
