saga goryu
"saga goryu" is a school of flower arrangement,whose founder was the emperor saga.
it is also called 'kado sagagoryu' (the sagagoryu school of flower arrangement).
origin
a japanese history book says that the saga goryu was founded in the konin period by the fifty second emperor,saga(october 7,786-august 28,842),who had set up his palace on the ground of daikaku-ji temple.
he often visited osawa-no-ike(osawa pond),daikaku-ji temple and nakoso-no-taki(rapids of nakoso),both of which were situated next to the temple,enjoying flower arrangement with the flowers blooming by the pond.
there is a description in the book that the emperor saga once said, 'from now on,i will respect a person as a mentor who admires the beauty of flowers' and encouraged the flower arrangement.
although 'saga goryu' later declined for a while,the fifty ninth emperor,uda(june 14,867-september 8,931),with the aim of reviving the traditional culture like flower arrangement,entrusted the revival work to koho mishosai,who learnt flower arrangement of the misho-ryu school,in the period when the emperor uda set up a rikyu(an imperial villa)on the ground of daikaku-ji temple.
accepting the emperor's offer,koho mishosai strove to spread the flower arrangement of saga goryu,with the result that 'saga goryu' became known nationwide.
