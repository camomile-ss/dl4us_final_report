sanetsuna sanjo
sanetsuna sanjo(1562-march 21,1581)was a kugyo(a top court official)who lived from the late muromachi to the azuchi-momoyama period.
although he served the imperial court mainly in the generation of the emperor ogimachi(the 106th),he was promoted only to shosanmi(senior third rank)in spite of being the family head of the sanjo family,which is a seiga family(one of the highest court noble families in japan at that time),because of his premature death.
he was raised to udaijin(minister of the right)after he died and was sadly missed.
his original name was kinnobu sanjo.
his biological father was naidaijin(minister of the center)saneki sanjonishi.
his elder brother was kinkuni sanjonishi.
he was from the sanjonishi family,the branch family of the ogimachisanjo family which was also a branch family of the sanjo family.
however,he succeeded the sanjo family because kinyori sanjo,the family head of the main branch of its family,did not have an heir when he got involved and was killed in the revolt of dainei-ji temple while he served in suo province.
he was conferred peerage in 1569.
later,he was promoted at a fast pace as a member of the seiga family and served as jiju(chamberlain),konoefu(the headquarters of the inner palace guards)and other positions in his early years until he became shosanmi(senior third rank),chunagon(vice-councilor of state)by 1580,but he died young the next year.
he died at the age of 20.
kinhiro sanjo,the second son of kinkuni sanjonishi,the biological elder brother of sanetsuna,succeeded the sanjo family.
