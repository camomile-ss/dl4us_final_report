later,the temple was moved to teramachi as a result of hideyoshi's urban development policy.
as the surrounding areas grew prosperous in the showa period,the temple moved to its present address in higashiyama ward in 1972 with the enlargement of the kyoto takashimaya building.
it was called daiun-in after nobutada's homyo(a buddhist name given to a person who has died).
