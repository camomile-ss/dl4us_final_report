nomura art museum is located at 61nanzenji shimo-kawara-cho,sakyo ward,kyoto city,kyoto prefecture
it is operated by nomura art foundation(財団法人野村文華財団).
summary
this museum was opened in 1984 with a collection of the second tokushichi nomura(1878-1945),who founded nomura securities co.,ltd.and other companies,as major exhibits.
although being a businessman,the second tokushichi was also a chajin(master of the tea ceremony)named 'tokuan,' and learned the tea ceremony under setsuan yabunouchi and the noh play under sakon kanze.
since tokuan had great knowledge of the tea ceremony and noh play,the items in the collection are centered on the two themes.
nanzen-ji temple and zenrin-ji temple are located nearby,and nomura hekiunso(literally,blue cloud)villa(野村碧雲荘),tokuan's another residence,is also located immediately north of the museum.
