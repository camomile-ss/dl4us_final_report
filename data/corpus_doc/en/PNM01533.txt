fujiwara no chiharu
fujiwara no chiharu(year of birth and death unknown)was a military aristocrat during the mid heian period.
he was the son of fujiwara no hidesato.
his children included fujiwara no hisayori.
since his father hidesato attained a great achievement during the taira no masakado's war,he was appointed to the imperial court and worked in kyoto.
in 967,he served as ise kogenshi(guard of the three checking stations of osaka,suzuka,and fuwa surrounding the capital)upon the emperor murakami's death.
he once fought against taira no yoshimori in the togoku(the eastern part of japan,particularly in the kanto region).
during that time,he held positions such as sagami no kuni no suke(assistant governor of sagami province),but when the direct descendant of the northern house of the fujiwara clan instigated 'anna incident' in 969 to expel other clans from the imperial court,he was hunted and captured by minamoto no mitsusue,who was a member of the opposing clan seiwa-genji(minamoto clan),and was overthrown and sentenced to banishment to oki province.
there is no further information about him.
