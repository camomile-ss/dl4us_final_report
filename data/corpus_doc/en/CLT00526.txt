geido refers to the performance of arts and handicrafts in a systematized way that is uniquely japanese.
this concept can normally be seen in the various nihon bujutsu(japanese martial arts)and the yusoku kojitsu(traditional protocol of the imperial court and samurai families)or reishiki(etiquette)that are derived from the practices and manners observed by court nobles in the edo period;it can also be seen in fields where skills are passed down from one generation to the next,ranging from performing arts such as nohgaku,kabuki,and ningyo joruri(traditional japanese puppet theater),hogaku(traditional japanese music),sado(tea ceremony),kado(flower arrangement),kodo(traditional incense-smelling ceremony),shodo(calligraphy),bontei(tray garden)to traditional handicrafts and classic gardening.
origin
originally,the word 'do' (or 'michi')meant 'system' in japanese and,as shown by the example in which wind and string instruments have been referred to as 'itotake no michi' since the dynastic period,it is thought that 'michi' or 'do' first meant simply 'system of art' when used in relation to the arts.
when various arts became systematized from the middle ages to the early modern period,it started to take on more meanings,not simply meaning system of performing arts and techniques,but also including ideas and philosophical backgrounds of arts,and the issue of how these metaphysical problems could be used in ascetic practice and daily life to heighten one's own art,leading to the establishment of the concept of geido.
the establishment of geido is commonly thought to have been greatly influenced by the popularization of esoteric theories and initiation ideas in medieval times,as well as the development of zen beliefs,according to which mentors are highly regarded.
characteristics
the main characteristic of geido is the idea that the heightening of one's art should be simultaneously accompanied by a heightening of one's personality because one's ethics and morality are directly revealed in one's art;this is derived from the idea that rather than regarding the performance of arts and techniques as merely a matter of skill,we should merge our everyday lives and the world of art,which is an opportunity to heighten our art and is itself a form of training.
it also values the systematic transmission of arts,and prioritizes vertical relationships over horizontal relationships with elements such as great respect for one's predecessors and a particular importance on the direct teacher-disciple relationship.
on the one hand,this way of thinking had various positive effects such as the establishment of ideas regarding gei that are peculiar to japan,respect for artistic views that place special importance on one's feelings and mental state,the correct passing on of arts knowledge from one generation to the next,and the deepening of arts not only through acquisition of its skills but also by speculation;on the other hand,it had a number of negative effects,such as worship of the powerful in the world of arts,mysticism,denial of universality,and development of a uniquely closed nature as represented by tsu(experts at certain arts).
this idea of geido,which is peculiar to japan,seems to interest foreigners,such that when german philosopher eugen herrigel was at tohoku university,for example,he was so impressed by how different the practice of kyudo(japanese archery)was from that of western-style archery that he wrote "zen in the art of archery," a book that has been introduced to the western world through various means.
the word 'geido'
the word 'geido' was coined as a general term for words such a as 'kendo,' 'kado' and 'sado' which came into use following the creation of the word 'judo.'
