history
the origin of shojoke-in temple lies in the buddha hall that jikaku daishi ennin began to build in the imperial palace in the year 860 under the order of emperor seiwa.
the temple came to be devoted to the pure land sect after emperor goshirakawa,emperor takakura and emperor gotoba studied the teachings of sect founder honen and he was subsequently granted the temple.
for this reason,honen is considered to be the restorer of the buddhist priesthood seminary in the palace and also a founder of nenbutsu(a buddhist invocation).
