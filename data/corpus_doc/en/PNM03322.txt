he was one of more than twenty men who followed prince oama when he left yoshino to take arms.
no records were kept of his other acts.
according to "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan),after the war on december 4,672,many were selected for their acts of valor,and were awarded a kan-i rank(literary translated,it means "crown rank";it was a rank awarded based on ability regardless of name and birth)of shosen(one of the rank levels)or higher.
