warikanoko(a kind of traditional hair styles of females which were popular in the edo period)
warikanoko was a hairstyle widely worn by women from their late teens to early twenties in the late edo period.
this hairstyle,in which the chignon of marumage(rounded hair style of a married woman)was split in two and tied showing a decorative cloth,was commonly worn by wives of wealthy merchants and sometimes by unmarried women working at restaurants such as machiai-jaya(tea house to lend seats and tables,or rooms).
it was somewhat a reversed version of ichogaeshi(butterfly style)hairstyle,and the decorative kanoko cloth(tie-dyed cloth with a pattern of minute rings),which bound up the chignon through a kogai(hair combing up spatula),gave a sweet impression.
characteristics
tie the hair into a ponytail,stick a kogai into the roots of the knot,tie the middle of the ponytail with a paper cord and divide it into two,and put them on both ends of kogai,turning the hair bundles inside out.
then,also divide the end of the part tied with a paper cord into two,make loops,and twist them around the roots of the hair crossing each other(just like making chigomage[hairstyle for kids]on the back of the head).
finish it by putting a tegara,decorative cloth,through the kogai.
