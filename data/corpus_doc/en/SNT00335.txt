mihashira-torii
mihashira-torii(literally,three-column shrine gate)is formed by coupling three torii(shrine gate).
because adjacent two trii share columns,the columns are not six but three.
mihashira-torii such as the one in kijima-jinja shrine(kaiko-no-yashiro(literally,silkworm shrine)in kyoto city in kyoto prefecture)is famous.
the style of torii of mihashira-torii is shinmei-torii and,therefore,nuki(a lateral bar joining columns)is only set in the inner space of columns.
