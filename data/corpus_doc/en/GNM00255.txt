this section on "town names in minami ward,kyoto city" lists official town names in minami ward and summarizes the period and process of their establishment.
summary of minami ward
it is located south of kyoto urban district.
it borders the ukyo ward and shimogyo ward in the north,higashiyama ward and fushimi ward from the east to the south,and nishikyo ward and muko city in the west.
it covers the area of 15.78 square kilometers.
its population is estimated to be about 99,000 as of march 2009.
jr tokaido line,tokaido and sanyo shinkansen and hachijo-dori street run from east to west across the ward near the northern edge.
while jr kyoto station is located in shimogyo ward,the area around its hachijo exit belongs to minami ward.
keihan-kokudo(national route 1)runs from south to north through the center of the ward.
the kamo-gawa river running in the east and the katsura-gawa river in the west both run to the south.
they converge in the south,shimotoba,fushimi ward.
the ward mainly covers the area between the two rivers as well as the kuze area along the western bank of the katsura-gawa river.
it is entirely a flatland.
it was for the most part a rural area when it was established.
it is now a mixed area of residence,commerce and industry.
it was within the current minami ward that there existed the rajo-mon gate which was the southern main gate to heian-kyo(ancient capital of japan),as well as the temples of to-ji and sai-ji which were built in the east and the west,respectively,of the gate.
with the exception of the to-ji(kyoogokoku-ji)temple,the ward has few sightseeing spots.
it used to be a part of shimogyo ward,from which it was separated to become an independent ward in 1955.
most of its areas were villages in the former counties of kadono and kii,which were then transferred to the former shimogyo ward in 1902,1918 and 1931.
the kuze area along the western bank of the katsura-gawa river belonged to kuze village,otokuni county and was incorporated into the ward in 1959.
summary of town names
the town names of kyoto city are categorized into those using their former village names or former oaza(large section of village)such as 'ohara raikoin-cho' (in this case, 'ohara' is the former name)and those using an independent name of a town such as 'kameya-cho' and 'kikuya-cho.'
with the exception of few isolated cases along jr tokaido line in the north,the towns in minami ward have compound town names which are prefixed by the district names such as former oaza(large section of village).
according to the second volume of "kadokawa nihon chimei daijiten no.26 kyoto-fu" (kadokawa dictionary of place-names of japan,no.26 kyoto prefecture),there were officially 269 declared towns as of 1980.
in certain parts of the ward,town names and boundaries were subsequently altered due to land readjustment projects.
a town was newly established and two were abolished.
the ward had 268 towns in 2009.
(1-chome to 5-chome,kuze nakakuze-cho was counted as one town.)
there are some towns which have no letter of 'ç”º' (read as 'cho,' meaning town)as a suffix,such as 'kamitoba choda.'
they were farmlands without houses when they were established in 1931.
