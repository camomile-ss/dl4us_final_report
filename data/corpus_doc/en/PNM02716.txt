he was adopted by shigeyoshi uesugi(the takuma-uesugi family),but the foster father was assassinated by ko no moronao who was a steward in the ashikaga family,due to his defeat of political war.

yoshinori,17 years old at the time,raised an army in hitachi province,and in 1351,he caused moronao's cousin ko no morofuyu's ruin by attack in suzawa,kai province(yamanashi prefecture).
after he got armed groups of kanto region in his clutches he went to the west,and he exploited a gap while takauji reconciled with tadayoshi and returned with ko clan including moronao,he devised a stratagem and executed moronao and a whole family in mukogawa,settsu province(itami city,hyogo prefecture).
tadayoshi ashikaga escaped from kyoto again and opposed to takauji,and yoshinori was defeated by takauji's troop at kanbara,suruga province.
he was sent into exile for a while,however,he was permitted later,and assisted the kamakura kubo(governor-general of the kanto region),ujimitsu ashikaga as a kanto kanrei(a shogunal deputy for the kanto region).
thereafter,the uesugi family takes the kanto kanrei post by succession.
