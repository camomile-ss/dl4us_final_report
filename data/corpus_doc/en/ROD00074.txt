yanaginobanba-dori street
the yanaginobanba-dori street is a street running north-south through kyoto city.
it runs from marutamachi-dori street in the north to gojo-dori street in the south.
it corresponds to madenokoji of heiankyo,
origin
in 1589 kyoto's or japan's largest brothel named nijo yanagimachi was located around the intersection with nijo-dori street.
it is said to have been built by order of hideyoshi toyotomi and surrounded by a row of beautiful willow trees.
in 1602,however,the brothel was relocated to rokujo due to the extension of the nijo-jo castle.
in 1604 the vacant land after the relocation was a venue for a large-scale horse competition show or parade,which explains the origin of the name of the street.
