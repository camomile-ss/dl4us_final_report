banjo(working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials)
banjo refers to a working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials such as zonin and so on in the ritsuryo system(a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)in japan.
as opposed to chojo(full-time working pattern),a part-time and shift working pattern was called banjo,and officials taking this working pattern were called bunban(shiftwork).
instead of bunban,such officials themselves came to be called banjo or banjokan later.
as compared with chojo,treatments and ranking were low,and it was extremely difficult for them to be promoted to a rank equivalent to or higher than goi(fifth rank).
