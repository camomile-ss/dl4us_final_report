sumiyoshi-zukuri style
sumiyoshi-zukuri style is one of the architectural styles of shrines in japan.
summary
sumiyoshi-zukuri style,which is typified by sumiyoshi-taisha shrine,is characterized by its ancient linear hafu(a barge board),and many have pointed out its resemblance to the building constructed in the daijo-sai festival(a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor).
it is one of the oldest architectural styles of shrines,along with shinmei-zukuri style,which is exemplified by ise-jingu shrine,and taisha-zukuri style,which is epitomized by izumo-taisha shrine.
structures
sumiyoshi-zukuri style architecture has no veranda(a narrow wooden passageway along the edge of a house facing the garden)or the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine,and the inside is divided into a naijin(inner sanctuary of a shrine or temple)and a gejin(part of the main sanctuary outside the innermost sanctum of a shrine).
it is rectangular with a width of approx.3.6 meters and a depth of approx.7.3 meters,approx.3.6 meters each for the naijin and gejin.
