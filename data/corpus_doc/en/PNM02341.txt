fujimasa tochi
fujimasa tochi(year of birth and death unknown)was a 'busho' (a japanese military commander)over the azuchi-momoyama to the early period of the edo era.
he was adopted as the husband for a daughter of tokatsu tochi.
his common name was jiro.
brief personal history
fujimasa was from the fuse clan,and when tonaga tochi made a close relationship with the tsutsui clan,fujimasa got married with tokatsu's daughter.
that led to troubles about the family estate and the tochi family fought in several groups.
however,every one of the tochi family served for junkei tsutsui.
on the new year's day 1581,a new year gift was given by eishun tamonin.
in 1582,fujimasa's legitimate son(later,fujimitsu tochi)was born.
when junkei tsutsui died of disease and sadatsugu tsutsui,his legitimate son,succeeded to the estate in 1584,fujimasa started to serve for sadatsugu but his uncle,tonaga,resigned and left the tsutsui family.
at the bunroku-keicho war(1592 to 1598),fujimasa's master,sadatsugu departed for the front and fujimasa played the role of 'rusuiyaku' (a person representing the master during his absence).
it is said that when sadatsugu tsutsui was punished by being deprived of his territory in 1608,fujimasa resigned and became a farmer.
it is also said that fujimitsu succeeded the estate and their descendants called themselves ueda clan.
