fukami-toge pass,which ran on the former road,became a tunnel pass today after fukami-suido tunnel was bored in 1946.
the route switched to run through fukami tunnel opened in september,2001,from fukami-suido tunnel.
since ancient times,the pass has been famous as a chokepoint of shuzan-kaido road.
it was one of the roughest zones in national route 162 as vehicles couldn't pass each other in the fukami-suido tunnel before,but after the fukami tunnel was opened,the pass serves well as a main road connecting kyoto prefecture and fukui prefecture.
features of the pass
as of 2009,fukami tunnel is called fukami-toge pass.
the former dirt road is impassable since it is closed halfway around the pass.
however,it is passable to the place where toge no jizo(a stone statue keeping its eye upon the travelers on the pass)is enshrined,people who head for the old pass can be seen.
fukami-suido tunnel is closed entirely on the both sides and impassable.
fukami tunnel,current fukami-toge pass,is easy to drive with two lanes wide and it has no shadow as a chokepoint at all.
