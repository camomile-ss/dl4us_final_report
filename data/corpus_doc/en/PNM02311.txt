yasutsune wakizaka
yasutsune wakizaka(year of birth unknown-may 22,1632)was a successor of the iida domain,shinano province.
his was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)awaji no kami(governor of awaji province).
he was the fifth son of yasuharu wakizaka,who was the first lord of the ozu domain.
he was adopted by yasumoto wakizaka,who was his older brother and the first lord of the iida domain,shinano province.
in 1632,yasutsune visited nagayoshi ikeda with his older brother yasunobu ikeda to complain about nagayoshi's will(stating that his first son,nagatsune ikeda,and the second son,nagazumi ikeda[the son-in-law of his older brother yasunobu wakizaka],would respectively inherit the two halves of nagayoshi's territory),but there,yasutsune had a fight with nagayori ikeda,a younger brother of nagayoshi,and was killed by him.
for this reason,yasutoshi wakizaka,a younger brother of masamori hotta who was one of the favorite retainers of seiitaishogun iemitsu tokugawa(commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians),was adopted by yasumoto and then became his legitimate child.
