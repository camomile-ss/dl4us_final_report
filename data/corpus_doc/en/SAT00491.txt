history
the details of its establishment are unknown.
according to legend,the temple was one of the 'makiyamasenbo' (priest lodges)run by monks from baekje in 575(it is also said to have been established in 771).
the main hall is assumed to have been built in the mid kamakura period,however,due to the absence of ancient structural remnants or artifacts of the same period found in the precincts of the temple,the entire temple is assumed to have been established in the kamakura period.
the statues of buddha,including the principal image of buddha were made in the heian period and are older than its hall,so they are assumed to have been brought from other places.
