okisome no oku
okisome no oku lived in the asuka period of japan.
his name oku(大伯)was also written as多久(the pronunciation was the same).
according to the old japanese syllabary characters,it is considered that his name had been pronounced as 'okisome no ofoku.'
his kabane was muraji.
in 654,he went to tang dynasty china as a member of kentoshi(japanese envoy to tang),and the next year he returned to japan.
in the jinshin war in 672,he supported prince oama(emperor tenmu).
he was accused of theft in 693,however,he was pardoned out of consideration for his service in the jinshin war.
in february,654,okisome no oku became a member of kentoshi with oshi(leader of envoy)takamuko no kuromaro and taishi(assistant leader of envoy)kawabe no maro.
at that time,oku's rank was shootsujo.
this kentoshi came back to japan in august,655.
although the name of okisome no oku isn't mentioned in the description of the jinshin war in "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan),the proclamation about his theft explained below proves that he had made achievements supporting prince oama.
on april 22,693,a proclamation was issued to judge the theft by otomo no ohito,okisome no oku,and uno no otomo,and to judge the connivance by kose no oji.
there is no concrete content described,however,considering the posts of the accused official,it seems to have been embezzlement of kanmotsu(tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes).
at that time,okisome no oku was kagitsukasa(or tenyaku)who managed keys.
he was demoted to one lower rank and removed from the imperial court,however,for the service in the year of jinshin(the jinshin war),he was given an amnesty with only one condition that he had to return those stolen things.
