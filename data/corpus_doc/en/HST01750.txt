kokuyaku kenpo
kokuyaku constitution defined laws that were formulated by representatives of the people and approved by the ruler(in japan's case it would be the emperor)and this procedure served as a sort of promise between the ruler and his people.
during the movement for liberty and people's rights sometime around 1880,the tokyo nichinichi newspaper,the choya newspaper,and other major newspapers claimed that,in order to simultaneous support both the people's rights and imperial order,a congress of the people should be convened to formulate constitutions drafts,which would be instituted once it met with the emperor's approval,and this opinion greatly influenced the populace.
at the national assembly association of the same year,it was voted that a constitution-forming body should be established before the opening of the national diet,and each province began formulating constituion drafts.
however,the following year,an imperial edict at the opening of the national diet declared that the constitutions would be created by the emperor,and the idea of a constitution created by the people's representatives never materialized.
