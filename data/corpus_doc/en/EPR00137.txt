dairi(the imperial palace)
"dairi" is the emperor's private area in the palace of ancient walled city.
it is also known as "gosho," "kinri," and "ouchi."
the palace(the emperor's house),which was the civic center,was located at the northern center of the walled city,and the dairi,which was the emperor's private residence,was located inside the palace.
dairi in heiankyo(the ancient capital of heian-kyo)
heiangu(the outer palace precincts),the palace,was located on the northern side of heiankyo,and the dairi measured approximately 300 m from north to south and 200 m from east to west in the easterly of the center within the heiangu.
this place is near the present-day senbon marutamachi intersection.
dairi was located on the north side of 'chodoin' which was the central government of the palace,surrounded by tsuijibei(a roofed mud-wall),and the inner palace was located on the north side and shishinden(the hall for state ceremonies)which was the emperor's state affairs office(seimusho)and seiryoden which was the center of daily life were located on the south side inside the dairi.
after heiankyo dairi was burned down in 960,it suffered several fires,and when satodairi(a temporary palace)became available,the emperor spent most of his time there,so the significance of the dairi was diminished.
the dairi in heiangu was never rebuilt after it was burned down during the kamakura period,and kyoto imperial palace(tsuchimikado higashi no toindono)which was the satodairi located on the east side of the dairi became the palace after the southern and northern courts,and shishinden and seiryoden were rebuilt within the palace in the recent times.
this is the present-day kyoto imperial palace.
