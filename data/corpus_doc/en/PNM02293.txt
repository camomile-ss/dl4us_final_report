when kintsune was caught by retired emperor gotoba immediately before the jokyu war,nagahira secretly sent a messenger to the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)to inform that the retired emperor killed kyoto military governor mitsusue iga and schemed to raise an army.
also,it is recorded that when the army of the kamakura bakufu came across the yodo river,he guided the army into kyoto.
