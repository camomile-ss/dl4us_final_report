daini-keihan-doro bypass
the daini-keihan-doro bypass is a bypass of the general national highway road no.1,which extends from fushimi ward in kyoto city,kyoto prefecture,to kadoma city in osaka prefecture.
it is comprised of four to six lanes of the exclusive section(expressway)and two to four lanes of the general section(general road)as side roads.
the development of this bypass is being promoted in order to relieve congestion on the keihan national highway,whose traffic volume has exceeded its capacity,and on the section between the suita junction/suita interchange of the kinki jidoshado expressway and the kadoma interchange(the kinki jidoshado expressway)(as well as the congestion occurring around the tennouzan tunnel and the kyoto minami interchange of the meishin expressway,as associated with the heavy traffic in the section mentioned above).
as a measure to improve the roadside environment,environmental facilities are provided along both sides of the road,which include side roads,planted zones,and lanes for cyclists and pedestrians.
the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism has nicknamed this bypass 'midori-tatsu-michi(a road with fresh foliage sprouting).'
the rakunan renraku road(local high-standard highway)is hereunder described collectively,because it is included in the service route of the daini-keihan-doro bypass as a general toll road.
exclusive section
it's an approximately 28.3-kilometer extended road for exclusive use by automobiles,and is designated as a planning route for the local high-standard highways.
the service route of the daini-keihan-doro bypass,as the general toll road,is the section from the union with the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line to kadoma junction.
as the local high-standard highway,it covers the(approximately 27.4-kilometer extended)section from the oguraike interchange to kadoma junction,and the remaining(approximately 0.9-kilometer extended)section from the union with the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line to the oguraike interchange is the rakunan renraku road.
overview
origin:the joint with the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line
terminus:kadoma junction
government order on road design standards,etc.:type 2 class 2,60 km/h,type 1 class 3,80 km/h
lanes:4 lanes,6 lanes
this construction is being promoted under the(road construction)method of merging public works and toll-road projects,whereby the west nippon expressway company limited assumes control from the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism during construction and operates the road as a general toll road.
the exclusive section is slightly shorter than the general section because the union of the exclusive section with the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line is near the left(southern)bank of the yodo-gawa river,1.4 km south of the origin of the general section.
the section stretching north of the oguraike tollbooth has four lanes(type 2 class 2;design speed 60 km/h),the section from the oguraike tollbooth to kumiyama junction has four lines(type 1 class 3;design speed 80 km/h),and the section stretching south of kumiyama junction has six lines(type 1 class 3;design speed 80 km/h).
the section south of the kyotanabe toll gate,which now has four lanes,will have six lanes when the section up to kadoma junction is complete.
the section from the oguraike interchange to the hirakata-higashi interchange was the first to open,and consequently the daini-keihan-doro bypass was partially opened to traffic on march 30,2003.
the section north of the oguraike interchange became accessible on january 19,2008 with the opening of the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line.
the section south of the hirakata-higashi interchange was scheduled to open within fiscal year 2007,but it is still under construction and scheduled for completion in the spring of 2010 due to a delay in land acquisition and opposition from the neighborhood.

tentative names are given for the sections to be opened.
on the daini-keihan-doro bypass,the distance marked on each respective sign originates from the oguraike interchange in the direction of kadoma junction,while on the rakunan renraku road the distance on kilometer posts,for example “洛0.5," which originates from the union with the hanshin expressway route no.8 kyoto line.

general section
this section is a general road 29.7 kilometers in extended length.
the road names under the city planning and the projects of the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism are rakunan road(the approximately 3.3-km extended section north of the keiji bypass in kyoto prefecture),kyoto minami road(the approximately 8.8-km extended section south of the keiji bypass in kyoto prefecture)and osaka-kita road(the approximately 17.6-km extended section in osaka prefecture).
overview
origin:yokooji-shimomisu,fushimi ward,kyoto city
terminus:hiejima,kadoma city
road design standards:type 3 class 1,design speed 60 km/h;type 3 class 2,design speed 60 km/h
lanes:4 lanes,2 lanes
the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism is implementing the project and managing the road.
the general section is regarded as the 'side roads' of the highway section,so it is designed to serve as a connection route with the interchanges of the exclusive sections as well as to provide interregional transportation.
accordingly,in the neighborhood the traffic guide sign 'national highway route no.1' directs drivers to the hirakata bypass,while the expressway-dedicated green sign 'daini-keihan-doro bypass' directs them to the expressway section via the general section.
the general section is slightly longer than the exclusive section because its origin is the union with the kyoto-sotokanjo-sen belt line,approximately 1.4 km north of the exclusive section's origin.
the section north of the kyotanabe-matsui interchange and the section south of the intersection with national highway route no.170 have two lanes in each direction(type 3 class 1;design speed of 60 km/h),and the section from the kyotanabe-matsui interchange to the intersection with national highway route no.170(type 3 class 2;design speed of 60 km/h)has one lane in each direction.
however,in the section between the kyotanabe-matsui interchange and the intersection with national highway route no.170,there are two lanes in each direction from the hirakata-higashi interchange to the intersection with national highway no.307(from the interchange of an exclusive section to a crossing of a major highway).
in the section south of the keiji bypass,zones for environmental facilities are provided along both sides of the road,consisting of side lanes(one lane and one-way traffic),lanes for cyclists and pedestrians,and planted zones,except along the sections built in a canal structure found between the kyotanabe-matsui and hirakata-higashi interchanges and between the hirakata-minami and katano-kita interchanges.
principally,it is connected to other roads through side lanes unless it is connected to a major highway.
it was initially planned to have two main lanes and two side lanes in each direction so that it could fully assume the function of the keihan national highway.
however,the plan was changed due to opposition from people living in the neighborhood;therefore,environmental facility zones were provided instead of the side lane,and the number of main lanes between the kyotanabe-matsui interchange and the intersection with national highway route no.170 was reduced to one in each direction so that it now supplements the function of the hirakata bypass.
uncompleted sections-the section crossing the kizu-gawa river(kyoto prefecture)(between the kumiyama-minami interchange and the intersection with kyoto prefectural road no.22,yawata-kizu-sen)and the section south of national highway no.307 are under construction but were scheduled to open in the spring of 2010 upon the opening of the entire exclusive section.
