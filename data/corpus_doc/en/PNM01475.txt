kuniyoshi nose
kuniyoshi nose(year of birth and death unknown)was a samurai from the end of the heian period to the early kamakura period.
he was the second son of minamoto no kunimoto(kunimoto nose).
his brothers were kuniyasu and motonao,and his children were shigetsuna tajiri(tajiri kaja),yasunori nose(kurodo nose),nakatsune and takayuki.
his official rank was jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and he held the post of hogendai(an administrative official of the retired emperor).
a pseudonym he used was 'nose hogendai.'
kuniyoshi allegedly joined the rank of gokenin(immediate vassals of the shogunate during the kamakura,muromachi and edo periods)while he inherited the soryo(fief)of the nose clan from his father and attended the imperial court as a samurai.
in a record dated april 28,1195 in the "azuma kagami" (the mirror of the east),a person named 'nose hogendai' attended a ceremony at todai-ji temple.
although it has not been confirmed,the person has been identified as kuniyoshi through the date and common name.
remarks in historical materials reveal that descendants of kuniyoshi had also worked as gokenin in kyoto.
