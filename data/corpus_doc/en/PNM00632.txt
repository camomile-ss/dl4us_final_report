his child was taira no masamori.
like his ancestors,he was based in ise province and in 1075,together with ryoshin,a monk of the tendai sect,he invaded tado jingu temple,a branch temple of to-ji temple,in kuwana district,claiming that the temple was a branch temple of the tendai sect.
this outcome was not approved by the imperial court and it can be said that the case was an example of masahira's over vigorous military actions in ise.
on the other hand,he served fujiwara no morozane and was engaged in law enforcement operations around kyoto.
when armed monks from enryaku-ji temple marched on kyoto in 1079,he set out with his brother,taira no suehira,and minamoto no yoritsuna to protect the capital.
in the jimoku(ceremony for appointing officials)of 1099,he was appointed kami of dewa province.
