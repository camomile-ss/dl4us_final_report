gyojisho
the gyojisho came into existence in the daijoe(first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned emperor)and so on in about the middle ninth century,gradually grew into a functionality-oriented project team in various regular/temporal rites and festivals,and dealt with general affairs of rites and festivals including supplying necessary goods.
generally it consisted of one shokei(chief),benkan(oversight department)and fuhito(note-takers).
the shokei was able to report to an emperor through kurodo(chamberlain)or the court,not via the daijokan(grand council of state),asking for instructions from a sekkan(regent to the emperor)as needed.
from the middle tenth century,this gyojisho,as an independent economic base,began to collect clothing from various districts and became an important pillar of executing imperial court affairs.
the above is about the gyojisho in the heian period,and even today a gyojisho is set in a big shrine or changed into a 'yaku.'
