preservation districts for groups of important historic buildings
the preservation districts for groups of important historic buildings refer to 'historic buildings preservation areas' ordained by local authorities under article 144 of the law for the protection of cultural properties of japan,of which the state(minister of education,culture,sports,science and technology)selects those which are especially important.
they are often summarily referred to in japanese as 'judenkenchiku,' 'judenken' or 'denken.'
summary
the law for the protection of cultural properties defines 'a group of historic buildings' as that which forms a historic landscape in unison with its surrounding environments such as towns formed around castles,posts(shukuba),shinto shrines,buddhist temples,ports,and/or farming or fishing villages.
this system is designed to preserve cultural property buildings in their 'aspect' (as a group)rather than as 'point' (individual entities).'
in the preservation areas it specifies not only buildings such as temples,shrines,houses,or warehouses but also 'structures' including gates,mud and stone walls,canals,and tombs,as well as 'environmental properties' such as gardens,hedges and trees.
once specified these areas are subject to preservation measures.
the local authorities determine 'preservation districts for groups of historic buildings' based on their city planning programs or ordinances.
the minister of education,culture,sports,science and technology then 'selects' (rather than 'designates')those which are most important based on local authorities' recommendations.
as of june 2008,83 districts were selected across the country.
issues concerning the preservation districts for groups of important historic buildings
in many selected preservation districts for groups of important historic buildings,roads have not been made suitable for automobile traffic.
this is because most of the selected districts are located on islands or in mountainous regions which have been left out from the development of infrastructures and which have therefore remained inconvenient for traffic,resulting in the decline of local industries.
many issues therefore have arisen as to the relationship between historic buildings and city planning roads,or the handling of automobile traffic caused by increasing tourists when a district is selected for national preservation.
likewise,once a districted is selected for national preservation,buildings in the district may be subject to constraints on extension or rebuilding.
unmannerly behaviours of increasing tourists(noises,rubbish,traffic jams,etc.)may become negative factors for those who live in the areas.
in tomonoura,fukuyama city,hiroshima prefecture,the local authority cancelled a plan for building a bridge by reclaiming the tono port as well as a townscape preservation plan since it considered that the bridge construction over the reclaimed port was inseparable from the preservation of the townscape.'
inhabitants who want the area to be selected as nationally important historic buildings district urged the city to go ahead with the townscape preservation plan independently of the bridge construction plan.
cooperation between the administration and inhabitants is essential when a historic buildings area is recommended as a preservation district for a group of important historic buildings.

supplementary notes
the lists were created in june 2008.
the preservation districts which have been changed due to the merger of local governments are all listed under their new names.
the district types are based on the national cultural properties database(see the section on the external links).
other district types than listed on the database are taken from the system of "preservation districts for groups of historic buildings" (see the section on the external links).
