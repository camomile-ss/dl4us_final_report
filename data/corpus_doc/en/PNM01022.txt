mitsunobu tosa
mitsunobu tosa(1434-june 20,1525)was a painter from the middle of the muromachi period to the sengoku period(period of warring states).
he was the successor to koshu tosa,but was actually mitsuhiro tosa's child.
he is considered the father of the restoration period of the tosa group.
according to a migyosho(order written by a substitute)by yoshimasa ashikaga,the eighth seii taishogun(literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians")of the muromachi bakufu(japanese feaudal government headed by a shogun),he was assigned as edokoro-azukari in 1469.
after becoming ukon no jo(lieutenant of the right division of inner palace guards),a kuzen-an(a written appointment)promoting him to gyobu no taifu(senior assistant minister of justice)was issued,and he obtained the highest position as a painter.
he painted many pieces for the aristocracy,military class and temples and enlarged the themes,techniques,and styles of yamato-e painting(a traditional japanese style painting of the late heian and kamakura periods dealing with japanese themes).
together with mitsunaga tosa(tokiwa),mitsuoki tosa,he is called one of the sanpitsu(three famous painters)of the tosa group.
many pieces such as 'seiko-ji engi' (legends of seiko-ji temple), 'kiyomizu-dera engi' (legends of kiyomizu-dera temple), 'kitano-tenjin engi' (legends of kitano-tenjin shrine)still exist today.
