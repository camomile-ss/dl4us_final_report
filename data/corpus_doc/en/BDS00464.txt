the nio-mon gate is a magnificent sangen-ikkomon gate(a 3x2-bay gate of an eight-legged style)of the irimoya style(a half-hipped roof)with a tochibuki roof(a type of board roofing in which boards are split along the straight grain and laid in such a way as to have a considerable overlap)has long been said to have been built in 680.
however,when the gate was taken apart and repaired from 1950 to october 1952,ink writing stating "1248" and munafuda(a historical plaque on a building)were discovered,and it was revealed that the gate had been reconstructed in 1248.
