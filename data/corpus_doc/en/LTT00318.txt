uji jujo
uji jujo(the ten quires of uji)is the latter half of the third,last part of genji monogatari(the tale of genji.)
it refers to ten quires from hashihime(the lady at the bridge)to yume no ukihashi(the floating bridge of dreams).
summary
only these ten quires are mainly set in uji city.
it is often thought that these quires are separated from the other quires,because there are a lot of differences like this.
in old books such as "hakuzoshi," "shimeisho," and "kachoyojo," the ten quires are separated and respectively called 'uji,part 1,' 'uji,part 2,' and so on.
therefore,it appears that this method of classification has existed from ancient times.
according to the old genealogical tree in shoka bon(book written in the shoka period),17 quires of narabi no kan(resemblance chapters)are counted out from 54 quires of genji monogatari,and uji jujo is counted as 1 quire of 'uji, ' and thus the total number of quires comes down to 28.
in "kachoyojo" by kanera ichijo, "segenmondo" by fuyuyoshi ichijo,etc.,uji jujo is thought to have been written by daini no sanmi,a daughter of murasaki shikibu.
a long-standing viewpoint is that the author of the ten quires is not murasaki shikibu.
there is a lot of research on this,including biten yasumoto's paper on quantitative analysis which concludes that murasaki shikibu is not likely to have written uji jujo.
each quire of uji jujo
uji jujo is often divided roughly into two parts:the first part is 'the tale of oigimi and naka no kimi' (the tale of the oldest and second-oldest sisters)which is from hashihime to sawarabi(early ferns),and the second part is 'the tale of ukifune' (the tale of a boat upon the waters)which is from yadorigi(the ivy)to yume no ukihashi.
