it is a basic national policy of the meiji government in japan.
japan,which fell far behind the western powers due to its national isolation policy in the edo era,was heavily burdened by the ansei five-power treaties long after its start as a renewed nation.
learning a lesson from this,japan aimed to revise the treaties and improve national security by strengthening its economic power with land-tax reform and encouragement of industries(national enrichment),and military power with the conscription system and reformation of the military system(strengthening of the military)to catch up with other great powers.
