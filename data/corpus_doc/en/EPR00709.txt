ikisomimi no mikoto
ikisomimi no mikoto(or okisomimi no mikoto,the date of birth and death unknown)was a member of the imperial family who appears in 'nihonshoki' (chronicles of japan)who lived during the kofun period(tumulus period).
he was the first imperial prince of emperor annei,and his mother was nunasokonakatsuhime no mikoto.
his younger maternal half-brothers include emperor itoku.
amatoyotsuhime no mikoto(empress of emperor itoku)was his only child,and it is described in 'sendai kujihongi' (ancient japanese history)that he had no heir.
there is a theory that regards him and tokotsuhikoiro no mikoto who appears in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters)and "nihonshoki" as the same person.
