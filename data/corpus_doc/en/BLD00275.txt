otori-zukuri style
otori-zukuri style is one of the architectural styles of shrines in japan.
summary
otori-zukuri style,which is typified by otori taisha shrine,is a style that developed from taisha-zukuri style,which is exemplified by izumo-taisha shrine.
it is a simple linear style that looks as if a roof is placed on a cube.
in a sense,it is a simplified sumiyoshi-zukuri style with a half depth.
structures
similarly to taisha-zukuri style,otori-zukuri style architecture is square-shaped with an area of approximately 3.6 sq.m.,but without a veranda(a narrow wooden passageway along the edge of a house facing the garden)or the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine.
the entrance is located at the center on the front,and the inside is divided into a naijin(inner sanctuary of a shrine or temple)and a gejin(part of the main sanctuary outside the innermost sanctum of a shrine)with a shinza(seat of the deity)situated at the center of the naijin.
otori-zukuri style employs kirizuma-zukuri style(an architectural style with a gabled roof)with a tsuma-iri(entrance on gable side),and many have more linear roofs than those of taisha-zukuri style.
roofs
the roofs are not necessarily thatched;there are wide varieties,from kokerabuki(a roof covering made with a layer of thin wooden shingles made of cypress)to hiwadabuki(cypress bark roof).
the hafu(a barge board)on the front that supports the roof is decorated with a gegyo(decorative wooden board used to cover the ridge and purlin ends on a roof gable).
pillars
the architecture is square-shaped with an area of approximately 3.6 sq.m.without the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine,or pillars at the center on the front.
walls
a double-door opening is provided at one location,at the center on the front.
floors
the floor is lower than those of taisha-zukuri style and shinmei-zukuri style.
