taira no masatame
taira no masatame(year of birth unknown-940)was a busho(japanese military commander)in the mid heian period.
he was a son of taira no yoshimochi and a younger brother of taira no masakado.
he was called 'goro soma.'
"sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy)says that he was the youngest brother of taira no masatake;however,according to "hitachi no daijo fu," he was masatake's elder brother.
he was masakado shiju shimousa no kami(governor of shimousa province).
summary
when masakado started to call himself 'the new emperor,' masatame was appointed to shimousa no kami;however,his power declined at a stretch after masakado died in the battle with taira no sadamori and fujiwara no hidesato on march 30,940,and eventually masatame,his families and retainers were killed one after another.
according to "moromori-ki" (diary of moromori nakahara),masakado's younger brother named 'masatane' plotted a rebellion together with tomo no arihari who was masatane's father-in-law and gon no suke(provisional vice governor)of mutsu province on april 12,940.
however,since the name 'masatane' does not exist in the family tree,it is said that 'masatane' was the same person as 'masatame.'
