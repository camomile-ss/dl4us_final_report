because munetane left shimousa province,and also because it was in the period of the northern and southern courts,his honryo(main domain)in shimousa province was usurped by munetane's younger brother,tanemune chiba.
the chiba clan came to be divided into two groups,a group in shimousa province and a group in hizen province.
munetane became the founder of the later chiba clan in kyushu(the hizen chiba clan),and the chiba clan based on shimousa province came to be taken over by the line of tanemune.
