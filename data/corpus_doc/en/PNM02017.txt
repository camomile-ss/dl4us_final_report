minamoto no yukikuni
minamoto no yukikuni(1081?-october 15,1153)was a busho(japanese military commander)in the late heian period.
he was the eldest son of minamoto no akikuni from settsu-genji(minamoto clan)(tada-genji).
his mother was a daughter of takayuki,who was kamon no suke(assistant director of the house repair and cleaning office).
his younger brothers included minamoto no tsunemitsu,minamoto no ariyori and minamoto no moritaka,and his sons included yorimori tada,kuniaki,yorinori tada,gyochi,and nakakuni.
according to "sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy),he held the rank of jushiinoge(junior forth rank,lower grade),and the titles of kurodo(chamberlain)and sado no kuni no kami(governor of sado province),and called himself "tada kurodo no daibu" (master of chamberlain).
he was the eldest son of minamoto no akikuni from the main branch of tada-genji.
however,since his father was suddenly exiled in the middle of the career progress,yukikuni supposedly inherited the tada-no-sho estate at his early age.
yukikuni also served sekkan-ke(the families which produced regents)like his grandfather,but very few historical materials are left about his subsequent behavior and it is assumed that tada-genji reduced its power after akikuni was exiled.
according to "taiki" (diary of fujiwara no yorinaga),in 1152 under such circumstances,he sheltered michitsugu,a monk of kofuku-ji temple who committed murder,inside the tada-no-sho estate in accordance with fujiwara no yorinaga's request;this implies that he acted as a trusted retainer of yorinaga,who was increasing the power as toshi choja(head of the fujiwara clan)at the time.
he died in 1153.
according to "sonpi bunmyaku," he died at the age of 72.
