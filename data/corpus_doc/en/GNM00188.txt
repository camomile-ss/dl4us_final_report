sugasaka-toge pass
sugasaka-toge pass is a mountain pass located between maizuru city and ayabe city in kyoto prefecture.
it has an elevation of 448 meters.
it is on kyoto prefectural road 51 maizuru wachi route linking maizuru,a major city in northern kyoto prefecture,and kanbayashi area of ayabe city which has historically strong ties with maizuru.
the pass,however,was a rough and narrow road with a series of steep slopes and sharp curves,so a bypass project to extend the road by 2.3 kilometers(including the 953-meter-extension with sugasaka minami tunnel)was started in 1995(sugasaka bypass).
accordingly sugasaka bypass was opened on november 8,2006.
sugasaka bypass is expected to promote exchanges between the two cities,by alleviating the conventional traffic regulations in winter drastically.
