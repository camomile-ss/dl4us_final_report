fujiwara no ieyasu
fujiwara no ieyasu(1080-1136)was a kugyo(court noble)who lived during the late heian period.
he was the second son of fujiwara no akisue who was the rokujo shuri no daibu(master in charge of construction on the palace from the rokujo fujiwara family).
ieyasu held the position of zuryo(head of the provincial governors)in various provinces,and in 1134 was assigned as a sangi(councilor)with the rank of jusanmi(junior third rank).
during the insei period(period of government ruled by the retired emperor),retired emperor shirakawa held great confidence in ieyasu and he held such positions as shirakawa-innotsukasa(an official within the retired emperor's office)and innocho betto(chief administrator of the retired emperor's office),along with his post of zuryo.
his family gained position as the main branch of zenshoji-ryu(zenshoji lineage),overcoming the lineage of his brother,fujiwara no nagazane.
he continuously received preferential treatment during the insei period of the retired emperor toba;ieyasu's legitimate son and successor,ienari,also played a central role within the cloister government by the retired emperor toba.
his descendants continue living today as the shijo family of the house of urin.
using the economic power ieyasu gained while holding the post of zuryo,he contributed to building many temples and pagodas,such as the shokongo-in.
his residence was reportedly located at sanjo higashinotoin(nakagyo ward,kyoto city).
