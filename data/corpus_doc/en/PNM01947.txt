sakanoue no kunimaro
sakanoue no kunimaro(year of birth and death unknown)was a person in the asuka period of japan.
his name was read as 'sakanouhe no kunimaro' in old japanese syllabary characters.
his kabane(hereditary title)was atai.
in the jinshin war in 672,he left the capital following takechi no miko(prince takechi)on the side of oama no miko(prince oama)(emperor tenmu).
the sakanoue clan was a toraikei shizoku(a clan who immigrated to japan from china or korea)who belonged to the yamato no aya clan.
when the jinshin war broke out,sakanoue no kunimaro seems to have been in omi no miya in the omi province.
when takechi no miko in otsu-kyo came to know the rising of his father,oama no miko,he escaped from the capital,went over kafuka and joined oama no miko and his party in tsumue yamaguchi on july 28.
those who followed takechi no miko at that time were tami no ohi,akasome no tokotari,okura no hirosumi,sakanoue no kunimaro,furuichi no kuromaro,takeda no daitoku and ikago no ahe.
kafuka was around koka county,omi province.
tsumue yamaguchi is assumed to have been a place which later became tsuge-go,ahai county,iga province(present tsuge,iga city),which belonged to ise province at that time.
there is no record of kunimaro's activities after that.
