career
he was given the title of the imperial prince in 1210.
because his mother's sister was the wife of minamoto no sanetomo,he was temporarily slated for appointment as a prospective seii taishogun(literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians")after sanetomo died a sudden death in 1219.
when his father,the retired emperor gotoba,was exiled after the jokyu war in 1221,the imperial prince was implicated in this to be exiled to kojima in bizen province.
it was said that he died in kojima,and some say that he was a remote ancestor of takanori kojima.
it is said that descendants of imperial prince yorihito have been serving as the successive sojo(high-ranking buddhist priest)of goryu sonryu-in temple,a temple for mountaineering asceticism located in kurashiki city,okayama prefecture.
