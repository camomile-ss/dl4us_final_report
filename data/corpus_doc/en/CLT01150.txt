technique
traditional hand-drawn yuzen requires extremely time-consuming work composed of twenty six processes for completion,therefore,techniques of dyeing a fabric with models or of print-type dyeing are mainly used.
a rough design is drawn with colors extracted from petals of blue asiatic dayflowers,and resisting agents,which are contained in a thin case,are placed on a fabric in a way similar to the way in drawing an outline with ink.
the glue made from sticky rice and rice bran was once used,and gum is used nowadays.
after that,it is colored,and then painted with the color for a base after covering the entire pattern with glue.
the detailed works such as drawing antennas of a butterfly,painting the eyes of a bird,or making gradation,are performed after peeling off the glue which covered the pattern.
it is completed after drying.
