osho
osho(sanskrit:upādhyāya)is an honorific title for buddhist priests.
the original meaning was a teacher who regularly gave instruction to a priest who has been ordained and entered the priesthood.
in "jujuritsu" it indicates the ordaining master.
in japan the title of daiosho(great osho)was given to ganjin,who came over to teach the precepts in 758,and later was used as a title of respect for high level priests,and eventually for those at the level of chief priest and above.
the manner of writing and pronunciation varies by sect,and in some regions the word is even shortened to 'ossan' or 'ossama' (with the accent in the beginning).
