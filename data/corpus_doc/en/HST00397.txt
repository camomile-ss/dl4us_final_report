enkyu senjimasu
an official national measure that was enacted by emperor gosanjo in 1072,enkyu senjimasu(also referred to simply as senjimasu)was used to implement new manor regulation policies,including a manor regulation ordinance issued during the enkyu era.
soon after it was designated,senjimasu was put into circulation throughout the nation,and until the beginning of the fourteenth century it functioned as an official measure holding constant authority within many private measures.
during the period of northern and southern courts and the muromachi period,however,private measures became increasingly prosperous and senjimasu also lost its public character.
