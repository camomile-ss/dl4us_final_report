daishi(priest)
daishi is a kind of honorific title in china and in japan bestowed to priests with high virtue by the imperial court,and many of them are okurina(posthumous names).
in china,according to chapter 'shishigo' (bestowment of title to high virtue monks)in the final volume of "daiso soshiryaku" (the essential history of great-sung monks)by zanning in the beginning of the northern sung dynasty,the origin is when shigo(title for high virtue priest) 'sanei daishi' was imperially bestowed to unko of east area of changan and 'joko daishi' was to sotetsu of west area of changan in discussion in engyosetsu(延慶節)on december 10,870,in the reign of emperor iso,in the latter half of the tang dynasty.
it means that it regards that there were only hoshigo(kind of title bestowed to monks with high virtue)and zenjigo(title given to master of zen buddhism)existing before that.
it states that after that,since bestowment of daishigo(same meaning as daishi)and shie(purple robe bestowed imperially)was issued excessively at the end of the tang dynasty,a command to prohibit them was officially announced in 921.
it concludes that even at the beginning of the sung dynasty,daishigo was never bestowed until 979.
however,at least in the reign of shino(king of jin),an example of emperor yodai of sui dynasty bestowing the daishigo 'chisha' to zhi-yi when the emperor had received bosatsukai(bodhisattva precepts)from him can be seen,so actually,the origin of daishigo can be thought to go back before that time.
in japan,in august of 866 in the reign of emperor seiwa,daishigo 'denkyo' and 'jikaku' were bestowed to saicho and ennin respectively,for the first time.
as dogo(a pseudonym as a priest)bestowed to priests,there are kokushigo(title given to the most reverend priest),zenshigo,and so on.
