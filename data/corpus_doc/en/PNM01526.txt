fujiwara no ienaga
fujiwara no ienaga(years of birth and death unknown)was a retainer of the imperial court in the late heian period.
he was the son of sangi(councilor)fujiwara no ieyasu.
his brothers included chunagon(vice-councilor of state)fujiwara no ienari(founder of the shijo family)and fujiwara no yasunari.
he attained the rank of shoshiinoge(senior fourth rank,lower grade)and the post of gyobukyo(minister of justice).
he served as kokushi(provincial governor)of several provinces including mino,tosa,bitchu and noto provinces.
his family,the zenshoji line of the rokujo family,has handed down shijoryu hochodo(the shijo school of japanese cuisine).
"kojidan" (talks of the past)contains an anecdote about the head of the family serving as a hochonin(chef),cutting and trimming a fish at a feast in front of emperor toba.
he served fujiwara no tadazane and his son,fujiwara no yorinaga,and often rode at the head when they went out.
due probably to that relationship,he is said to have participated on the retired emperor sutoku's side in the hogen war in 1156 and his name is included in "hogen monogatari" (the tale of the hogen war)among the court nobles who became priests or surrendered after the war.
his specific movements after that,including any punishment he received,is unknown.
