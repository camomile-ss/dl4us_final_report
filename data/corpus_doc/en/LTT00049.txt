nijo kawaha no rakusho(the nijo river beach lampoon)
nijo kawaha no rakusho are writings collected in "kenmu nenkan-ki," a record of the kenmu era which was handed down in the machino clan,which was the head of monchujo(board of inquiry)in muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
it consists of 88 stanzas,and was written in seven-and-five-syllable meter,criticizing and satirizing politics and society in the chaotic days of the kenmu restoration.
experts in history consider it to be one of the best lampoons.
hand written copies(criticizing and satirizing politics and society)have been passed down through the years up until today,and it is said to have been displayed at the nijo river beach near nijo tomikoji street in the kamogawa river basin(yodogawa river system)(near the present day nijo-ohashi bridge,nakagyo ward,kyoto city)where the kenmu regime's office was.
the lampoon was displayed on august,1334,when the kenmu restoration was inaugurated by emperor godaigo after the fall of the kamakura bakufu.
the editors are unknown,but there are rumors that it was written by nobles,kyoto's young people,or monks who were dissatisfied with the kenmu regime.
taking a look at the text,you can see that it was written in a kind of verse,so it must have been written by someone who was familiar with chinese poetry and waka poems.
