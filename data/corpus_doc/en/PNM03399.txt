akishino no yasuhito
akishino no yasuhito(754-march 17,821)was a nobleman who lived in nara and heian periods.
yasuhito's father was haji no chimura(haji no uji).
yasuhito originally had kabane(hereditary aristocratic title used in ancient japan to denote rank and political standing)of haji sukune(the kabane of sukune referred to the third highest rank)and had a residence in akishino in the suburbs of heijo-kyo(which was also called heizei-kyo,the capital city of japan during nara period in the eighth century,)but in 782 the imperial court granted yasuhito a leave for the use of a set of uji(which indicated the lineage group)and kabane of the 'akishino ason' (the kabane of ason was more classically called asomi,indicating the second top rank).
hani shi no sukune was the native clan of emperor kanmu's maternal grandmother.
upon command of emperor kanmu did yasuhito edit the "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued),thereby being appointed sangi(councilor)in 805,but he fell from power once on the grounds that he was involved in an incident of imperial prince iyo.
yasuhito had a series of prominent positions such as sadaiben(major controller of the left)and sahyoe no kami(captain of the left division of middle palace guards),and was raised to an official court rank of jusanmi(junior third rank)in 815.
during the reign of emperor saga,yasuhito compiled "konin kyakushiki" code(amendments to penal and administrative law compiled in 820).
