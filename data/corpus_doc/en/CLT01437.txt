chirizuka-kaio(ghost king of waste)
chirizuka-kaio(ghost king of waste)is a type of japanese yokai(specter).
as the name indicates,it is considered as the king of waste-related tsukumogami(the term tsukumogami refers to a type of japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive).
in sekien toriyama's "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (the bag of one hundred random demons;the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki,replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough,most of the yokais shown in this book are the tsukumogami),it is portrayed as an ogre who prizes a karabitsu(chinese-style chest)open.
moreover,there is a similar picture of the ogre who prizes a karabitsu open in the "hyakki yagyo emaki" ('night parade of one hundred demons' picture scroll)of the muromachi period.
in addition,the 72nd chapter of "tsurezuregusa" (essays in idleness)says: 'the things that are not unsightly even if there are too many are books on fuguruma(a small cart with shafts,used for carrying books)and waste in chirizuka(dust heap).'
since much content of the "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" is based on the "hyakki yagyo emaki" and "tsurezuregusa," the chirizuka-kaio is also allegedly a sekien's creation based on these books.
further,the above-cited 'books on fuguruma' passage is also the source of creation for 'fuguruma-yobi' introduced in the "hyakki tsurezure bukuro."
