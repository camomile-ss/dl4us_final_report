opening
the seeds in peoples' minds grow into tens of thousands of words,and that is the essence of japanese poetry.
people in the world are likely to express what they have in mind every time they see and hear things as well as when they experience many things under various situations.
how could they refrain from making poems when they listen to nightingales in the blossoms or frogs in the water?
it is poetry that,without any strength,shakes the heaven and the earth,makes invisible spirits moved,makes a man and woman intimate and eases a warrior's violent soul.
