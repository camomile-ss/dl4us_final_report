tsukubo
tsukubo is one of the tools for capturing criminals which was used in the edo period.
it is also one of the three tools along with sasumata(two-pronged weapon)and sodegarami(pole weapon with multiple barbed heads).
summary
it is t-shaped and looks very much like shumoku(wooden bell hammer),with its head made of iron.
it has a lot of spikes and a long shaft(about two or three meters).
it is used in the same manner as sodegarami,catching a criminal's clothes and hair and suppressing his/her movement.
at present there are only a few schools that teach an art of using tsukubo as a weapon.
