fuki(yose(storyteller theater))
fuki was a yose of kamigata rakugo(traditional japanese comic storytelling as performed in the kyoto-osaka region)that existed in the past.
there were two yose called fuki,that existed at shinkyogoku,kyoto city for about 30 years since early showa era,and another existed at uehommachi,osaka city from meiji era to taisho era,though they shared the same name,they were not related to each other.
fuki of shinkyogoku
it was also called 'fuki-tei rakugo hall' or 'fukiseki seats'.
fuki means to do a business that is like two sides of the same coin.
originally it started as a theater/yose for rakugo(traditional comic storytelling)and manzai(a comic dialogue).
however fuki started to have small audience because of the popularity of kyoraku theater,which was established by nippon dream kanko as succession of ebisubashi shochiku theater,so that theatrical play with sword-rattling play and hand weaving demonstration was mainly performed,but theatrical performance was finished at nakaseki(performance showed from 11th to 20th of the month)of december 1958.
after that,fuki was converted into strip theater and then closed its door.
it is now matsumotokiyoshi co.,ltd.,shinkyogoku,kyoto,as of 2009.
it was famous for small back stage of yose.
fuki of uehommachi
a formal name was 'fukiseki seats'.
it used to be one of base joseki(rakugo theaters that open every day)for 'anti-naniwa rakugo(naniwa-style of rakugo storytelling)group' in meiji to taisho era.
