kaiseki ryori is a form of japanese cuisine.
description
kaiseki ryori is served at banquets.
in modern times it has become the most authentic style of japanese meal to serve at ceremonies,as 'honzen ryori' (a ritual meal served on a 'honzen' or legged tray)has fallen out of general use.
the term, "kaiseki" (会席)originally referred to a poetic gathering,especially one practicing renga(linked verse)and haikai(17-syllable verse).
it is often confused with the homonymous term, 'kaiseki' (懐石referring to tea-ceremony dishes).
though they share the same root,these two have been clearly separate since the late 16th century.
tea-ceremony dishes are designed to enhance the taste of matcha(finely powdered green tea)and kaiseki ryori sake(japanese rice wine).
ever since restaurants began to serve kaiseki ryori in the edo period,they have created various dishes suitable for drinking parties.
the basic menu of kaiseki ryori consists of three dishes with soup(usually japanese broth,together with sashimi or slices of raw fish,grilled and boiled foods).
to this are added an otoshi(appetizer),deep-fried and steamed foods,aemono(vegetables and fish in various dressings),vinegared dishes,pickles,and fruit.
