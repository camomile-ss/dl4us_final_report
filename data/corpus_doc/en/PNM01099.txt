jotomonin kouma no myobu
apart from the japanese poetry maker above,there was another kouma no myobu who was the daughter of sei shonagon,well-known for "makura no soshi" (the pillow book).
myobu's father was "fujiwara no muneyo."
she served fujiwara no shoshi(called jotomonin),the empress of emperor ichijo,so she was called jotomonin kouma no myobu.
myobu's poem was selected into 'goshui wakashu' (later collection of gleanings of japanese poetry).
