hata no kimiharu
hata no kimiharu(date of birth unknown-february 21,1152)was a government official(lower or middle ranked)near the end of the heian period.
he was a zuijin(an attendant)of sadaijin(minister of the left)fujiwara no yorinaga and a fusho of sakonefu(left division of inner palace guards).
he was known as a gay partner of yorinaga.
in 1145,yorinaga got angry with the remission of kunisada,meshitsukai(inferior officer)who was a murderer,and had kimiharu secretly kill this criminal.
as kimiharu suffered from diabetes mellitus,yorinaga sometimes made a buddhist service(a buddhist service for the dead)to pray for recovery.
after kimiharu died in spite of yorinaga's prayers,however,yorinaga missed 3 months of kuji(public duties)and lowered his own reputation.
