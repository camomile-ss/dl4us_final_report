amenokoyane no mikoto
amenokoyane no mikoto(written in kanji as天児屋命)is a god(shinto)that appeared in japanese mythology.
it is also written as天児屋根命when it refers to an enshrined deity in a shrine.
it is also called kasuga gongen.
his wife was amenomitsutamateruhime no mikoto.
a child of居々登魂命.
during iwato-gakure(the hiding of amaterasu omikami,the sun goddess,in the heavenly rock cave),he sang norito(shinto prayer)in front of the rock cave.
when amaterasu omikami slightly opened the cave,he and futodama showed her a mirror.
he accompanied ninigi during tensonkorin(the descent to earth of ninigi,the grandson of the sun goddess),and became the patriarch of nakatomi clan.
a part of his name 'koyane' means 'a small roof(of a building)',therefore it is thought to be the location of a deity who gives an oracle.
because he was a soshin(ancestor honored as god)of nakatomi no muraji,he was believed to be a private deity of the fujiwara clan whose patriarch was fujiwara no kamatari.
he was also a god of norito and career success.
he was enshrined in nakatomi-jinja shrine(yamashina ward,kyoto city),hiraoka-jinja shrine(higashi-osaka city,osaka prefecture),kasuga-taisha shrine(nara city,nara prefecture),and yoshida-jinja shrine(sakyo ward,kyoto city).
a god called 'otorinomuraji no oyagami' that is enshrined in otori-jinja shrine throughout the country is sometimes considered to be identical to amenokoyane no mikoto.
according to a scholar of japanese classical literature in late edo period,atsutane hirata,this god is identical to omoikane(the god of wisdom and talent).
