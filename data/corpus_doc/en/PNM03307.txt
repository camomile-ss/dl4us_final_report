higuma kato
higuma kato(year of birth unknown-june 23,1867)was a common member(regimental soldier)of the shinsengumi(literally,the newly selected corps,referring to a special police force for the tokugawa regime)and was a側越人of kanryusai takeda.
it is unknown as to when higuma joined the shinsengumi.
higuma participated in the sanjo-ohashi bridge noticeboard incident(which is called 'sanjo seisatsu jiken' in japanese)taking place on september 12,1866.
higuma received a reward of 7 ryo 2 bu(the terms ryo and bu were the unit of gold currency in edo;1 ryo being equal to 4 bu equal to 16 shu,where the ryo,bu and shu are denominational units),which was the same amount of money as that given to kensuke yaguchi.
when the shinsengumi was formally employed as a group of mercenaries by the shogunate on june 10,1867,higuma's name was included in a record as a hira-doshi(common soldier).
following the savage killing(assassination)of(kanryusai)takeda on june 22,1867,higuma escaped from the shinsengumi.
it is said that on june 23,1867,the captured higuma was executed by committing seppuku(or hara-kiri,meaning disemboweling himself)at the shinsengumi headquarters('tonsho' in japanese).
