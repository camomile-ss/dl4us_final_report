shusseken
"shusseken" means something transcends "seken," which refers to all the existence of the world corrupted by evils such as earthly desires.
the modern word 'shusse' that is generally used to mean a successful career originated from 'shusseken' and has five usages shown below.
the usage 3(and supposedly the usage 4)includes the state opposite to 'shusseken',i.e.,the state of being wrapped in 'seken',which shows that the general usage diverges from the original religious meaning.

in the past,in mt.hiei of the tendai sect,a son of a court noble ordained as a buddhist priest by receiving the commandments of buddhism and by shaving his head was called 'shusseken.'
the modern general phrases like 'shusse ga hayai' meaning 'rise by leaps and bounds' and 'risshin shusse' meaning 'succeed in life' originated from the fact that the priests from court noble families were promoted fast.

in buddhism,all the philosophical thoughts other than buddhism,i.e.,the non-buddhist doctrines,are based on the secular wisdom that does not transcend attachments to things.
