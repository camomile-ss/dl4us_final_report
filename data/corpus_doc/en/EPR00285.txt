fujiwara no shokushi(taneko)(1157-october 22,1228)was the empress consort of emperor takakura.
she was also called shokushi bomon.
she was the real mother of imperial prince morisada(gotakakura-in)and emperor gotoba.
her father was jusanmi(junior third rank)fujiwara no nobutaka.
her mother was fujiwara no kyushi,the daughter of okura-kyo(the minister of treasury)fujiwara no michifusa(okura-kyo).
nobukiyo bomon,who held the post of naidaijin(minister of the center),was her younger maternal half-brother.
her nyoin(a title given by the imperial court)was shichijoin.

she was called tenji(lady-in waiting)by emperor takakura and she gave birth to the second prince,imperial prince morisada(gotakakura-in),and the fourth prince,imperial prince takahira(emperor gotoba).

she outlived gotakakurain in her last years and died in 1228 at the age of 72 without meeting gotobain again.
