shinsengumi
kobungo enrolled in the shinsengumi around october 1864.
in december 1864,he was assigned to the fifth squad led by syuntaro ogata.
in february 1866,he was in charge of assisting the suicide of the accountant kisaburo kawai,who was sentenced to commit suicide by disembowelment because for embezzlement.
it is said that he cut kisabro's head in his third try after first hitting kisaburo's shoulder and then,his head.
it is said that kobungo had said at the time: "i have never imagined people capable of making such agonizing sound."
after that,kawai's family held a grudge against kobungo,and kobungo was attacked by someone(probably a kawai's relative)injuring his neck.
he survived,but his neck was skewed because of the injury and inappropriate treatment.
he was nicknamed 'kobungo the skewed head."
he later became a corporal and fought in the battle of toba and fushimi started in january 1868.
he withdrew to osaka because of injury and returned to edo.
he ran away from the shinsengumi soon afterwards.
