tadaaki sakai(the lord of obama domain of wakasa province)
tadaaki sakai(august 4,1813-december 5,1873)was a daimyo(japanese feudal lord)in the end of the edo period.
the twelfth and the fourteenth lord of obama domain of wakasa province.
the thirteenth and the fifteenth generation of the sakai family in obama domain.
the fifth son of tadayuki sakai,the tenth lord of the domain.
his lawful wife was the daughter of terunobu okochimatsudaira.
his children were tadahiro sakai(count)(the eldest son),and daughters(lawful wife of tadauji sakai),(third wife of sukeyori ito),(lawful wife of tadayoshi sakai).
the last official rank was jushijoshosho(junior fourth rank,upper grade minor captain)and shuri no daibu(master of the office of palace repairs).
he was commonly known as yoshichiro or yunosuke.
his name beside tadaaki,was tadatoshi.
he took part in the shogunate government in the end of the edo period,and acted as kyoto shoshidai(the kyoto deputy)from the years 1843 to 1850 and from 1858 to 1862.
when succession race over iesada tokugawa's successor arose,he supported iemochi(yoshitomi)tokugawa and oppressed the hitotsubashi family.
it is said that this became one of the causes of the later ansei no taigoku(suppression of extremists by the shogunate)by naosuke ii.
he also devoted himself to kobu-gattai(integration of the imperial court and the shogunate)such as kazunomiya koka(the marriage of kazunomiya imperial princess to an ordinary person).
hated by the sonnojoi ha(supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians),he was made a target in the teradaya incident.
in 1862,he was accused of misgovernment during his years of service,and had to hand over the position of lord of the domain to his adopted son-in-law,tadauji,and was driven to abdication of the headship of a family and suspension from the office.
in 1868,from tadauji's retirement due to suspension with actions supportive of the shogunate,he changed his name to tadatoshi and regained his position as the lord of the domain.
in 1873,he died at the age of 61.
