yuge no toyoho
yuge no toyoho is a person in the tumulus period of japan.
the year of birth and death unknown.
kabane(hereditary title)is muraji.
he killed oshikawachi no katabu who had profaned a shinto ritual and run away,by order of emperor yuryaku.
the yuge clan was a tomonomiyatsuko(the chief of various departments at the imperial court)that supervised yugebe in charge of making bows,and toyoho is the oldest person of the yuge clan appearing in a history book.
he only appears in the article of february 1,465,emperor yuryaku, "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan).
on that day,emperor yuryaku dispatched oshikawachi no katabu and a court lady to worship munakata sanjojin(three goddesses enshrined in munakata-jinja shrine).
however,as katabu had assaulted the court lady before the shinto ritual,the emperor sent naniwa no hitaka to kill him,but katabu ran away and disappeared.
therefore yuge no toyoho was sent to search for him.
after searching prefectures in japan,he captured and killed katabu in ainohara,mishima county(present ai,ibaraki city,osaka prefecture).
