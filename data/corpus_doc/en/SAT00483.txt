in the edo period it was considered as a sukei no yashiro(literally means a shrine of reverence)of minakuchi domain.
in 1842 the 'koka incident' occurred,in which tens of thousands of farmers got together in front of the main building of this shrine and rose against the land survey conducted by the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
