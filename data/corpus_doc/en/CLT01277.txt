kouchigi
kouchigi is one of japanese clothing.
it is an outerwear worn especially by those who were high class among the noblewomen.
according to the "ihon shimeisho," a commentary of genji monogatari(the tale of the minamoto clan)from the mid kamakura period,its length was about kosode(a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing by the upper classes)(in other words,the length is close to one's height),made in threefold(with nakabe,a lining cloth attached between the outer material),and a hitoemon(a single design,diamond shaped design such as ones used on a single layered kimono)pattern is used on the lining.
there is an article left by the deceased in tsurugaoka hachiman-gu shrine which originates in the kamakura period.
