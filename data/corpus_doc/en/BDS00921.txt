shinzan shiki
shinzan shiki refers to a ceremony when a new chief priest comes into a temple.
temples mostly have sango(literally, "mountain name"),which is the title prefixed to the name of a buddhist temple,and this ceremony means to enter the mountain.
the nichiren shoshu sect uses this term only for sanuki honmon-ji temple,myoren-ji temple and jozen-ji temple with head temple status(alternation mass in taiseki-ji temple),and other temples call the ceremony 'nyuin shiki(temple-entering ceremony).'
this term is used in buddhist countries including china and sri lanka aside from japan.
jodo shinshu(the true pure land sect of buddhism)calls it jusyoku keisyo(succession of the chief priest at a buddhist temple)because they don't use sango.
