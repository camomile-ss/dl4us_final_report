fujiwara no yasunari
fujiwara no yasunari(years of birth and death unknown)was a retainer of the imperial court at the end of heian period.
he was the son of sangi(councilor)fujiwara no ieyasu.
his brothers included chunagon(vice-councilor of state)fujiwara no ienari(founder of the shijo family)and fujiwara no ienaga.
he attained the rank of jushiinoge(junior fourth rank,lower grade)and the posts of kurodo(chamberlain)and governor of mino province.
since he was the son of emperor sutoku's wet nurse,he served the emperor and was called shin-in hogandai(an official of the newly-retired emperor's office.)
he was appointed kurodo in 1127,promoted to shogoinoge(senior fifth rank,lower grade)in 1146 and then to jushiinoge(junior fourth rank,lower grade),or possibly shoshiinoge(senior fourth rank,lower grade).
however,he participated on the side of the retired emperor sutoku in the hogen war in 1156.
"hogen monogatari" (the tale of the hogen war)describes that,when the retired emperor left ninna-ji temple to go into exile after losing the battle,he used yasunari's cart.
however,yasunari's movements after the war,including any punishment he received,are unknown.
