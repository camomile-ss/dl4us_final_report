nobuto tsuda
nobuto tsuda is busho(a japanese military commander)and daimyo(a feudal lord)from the sengoku period(period of warring states)(japan)through the azuchi-momoyama period.
a vassal of the toyotomi clan.
he was born as the oldest son of moritsuki tsuda.
he served as a vassal of hideyoshi hasahiba(hideyoshi toyotomi)from an early period,and in 1573 was appointed to kihoroshu(the bodyguards to hideyoshi).
in 1593 due to his father's death,he succeeded to the family estate.
he is said to have owned 35,000 koku as the lord of mimaki-jo castle of yamashiro province.
in the same year,however,he was arrested as a criminal of the incident of killing one thousand people with a sword in the suburbs of kyoto in yamashina,for which not only he took the tonsure and called himself長意,but also was deprived of being a samurai and taken into custody of toshiie maeda.
his family estate was succeeded by his younger brother nobunari,after the territory was diminished into 13,000 koku.
after that his whereabouts is unknown.
some say that since nobuto was pro-hidetsugu-toyotomi faction,he was slandered by bugyo(the magistrate)such as mitsunari ishida and others,and driven into a downfall.
