the usei-kai
the usei-kai,which lasted for three days,from june 17th(monday)to june 19th(wednesday),1907,is the name given to an evening banquet held by kinmochi saionji,then prime minister,at his private residence in kandasurugadai,to which he invited various japanese literati.
note that the name "usei-kai" (literally "rain sound party")was coined after the fact.
this is said to be the first time since the start of the meiji period that the prime minister of the entire nation invited people of letters to such an event.
