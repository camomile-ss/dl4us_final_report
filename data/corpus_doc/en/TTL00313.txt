oomi(a government post in ancient japan)
ooomi was a post in the yamato kingdom in the kofun period.
ooomi assisted ookimi,the king,in administering the country by heading taifu who followed the kingdom.
the leading figure among prominent leaders with a kabane title omi took the position of oomi.
in "nihonshoki," the name takeuchi no sukune appears as the first ooomi,but he is not considered a real person.
but the members from the powerful clans like the kazuraki clan,the heguri clan,the kose clan,and the soga clan,all of which claimed that they were descended from takeuchi no sukune,became ooomi.
ooomi was appointed personally by ookimi for the reign:for the reigns from emperor hanzei to emperor anko during the middle of the 5th century,katsuragi no tsubura was appointed ooomi;for the reigns from emperor yuryaku to emperor ninken during the latter half of the 5th century,heguri no matori was appointed ooomi;for the reign of emperor keitai during the first half of the 6th century,kose no ohito was appointed ooomi;and for the reigns of emperor bidatsu to emperor suiko from the latter half of the 6th century to the early 7th century,soga no umako was appointed ooomi.
after soga no umako defeated mononobe no moriya,the oomuraji,the system of oomuraji was virtually abolished and umako became the sole consul;thereafter,the soga clan monopolized the key positions in politics and soga no emishi,a son of umako,succeeded ooomi.
in 645 during the reign of emperor kogyoku,soga no emishi killed himself in the isshi incident,which was the end of the prosperity of the soga clan.
emperor kotoku,who was enthroned immediately after the incident,replaced ooomi with sadaijin and udaijin to prevent one post from grasping the authority.
