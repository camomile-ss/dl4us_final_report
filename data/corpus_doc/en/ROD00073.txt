tominokoji-dori street
the tominokoji-dori street is a street running north-south in kyoto city.
it extends in the north from the marutamachi-dori street and leads in the south to the kamijuzuyacho-dori street north of shosei-en garden.
it did not exist in heiankyo and was built by hideyoshi toyotomi according to his tensho zoning.
there was a street which possessed the same name of tomikoji,which corresponds to the current fuyacho-dori street running a block east.
the reason for the change of the name is not known.
in the north it originally ran to shimotachiuri-dori street but the section north of marutamachi-dori street was closed due to the extension of the imperial palace after the great fire of hoei in the early 18th century.
therefore a gate of the kyoto imperial palace is named tominokojiguchi at the northern end of the street.
the section south of the rokujo-dori street may be regarded as an extension of the yanaginobanba-dori street,because the section south of the gojo-dori street curves slightly westward
this area used to be rokujogawara and a district in south of the current gojo-dori street has another name,shimoderamachi(literally meaning lower temple town),because it is like teranomachi where temples were forced to move according to the kyoto reconstruction plan of hideyoshi toyotomi.
