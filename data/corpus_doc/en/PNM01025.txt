inbe no hironari
inbe no hironari(year of birth and death unknown)was a government official(esp.one of low to medium rank)at the beginning of the heian period(from the eighth to ninth century).
his hereditary title was sukune(third of eight hereditary titles).
in 807 he wrote 'kogo-shui' (history of the inbe clan)by the order of emperor heijo.
the inbe(written as斎部or忌部)clan had been in charge of religious services in the imperial court with the nakatomi clan,but when the fujiwara clan which originated from the nakatomi clan came to power,the nakatomi clan strengthened its influence on religious services,thereby pressuring the status of the inbe clan.
therefore,he pressed the rights of the inbe clan by writing 'kogo-shui' (history of the inbe clan).
as a result,he was conferred jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)in the following year,808.
