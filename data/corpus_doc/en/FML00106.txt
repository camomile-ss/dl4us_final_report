the takatsuji family
the takatsuji family is toshoke(hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank),whose patriarch was michizane sugawara's descendant,koretsuna takatsuji(shoshiinoge-senior fourth rank,lower grade),daigakuryo(bureau of education under ritsuryo system)(1030-1107).
incidentally,ariyoshi karahashi(jushiinojo-junior fourth rank,upper grade),shikibusho(minister of ceremonies),jusanmi(junior third rank)posthumously conferred)(1041-1121),who was the patriarch of the karahashi family,was the younger brother of koretusna takatsuji.
the family status is hanke(family of lower ranking court nobles)(kuge-court noble).
at the beginning,the family's pedigree was shii(fourth rank)at the most,just like the nobilities of provisional governor rank.
however,sugawara no tamenaga(tamenaga takatsuji)(1158-1246)from the early kamakura period was promoted to a sangi(councilor)and the family joined the rank of court nobles.
after tsunenaga takatsuji(1414-1475)during the muromachi period,the highest appointed court position was dainagon(chief councilor of state),after serving as monjo hakase(professor of literature)and in daigakuryo and shikibusho.
the gojo family branched out of the takatsuji family during the kamakura period.
serving as historians was their family profession,and they served as imperial tutors to the emperor for generations.
the family line ended with the generation of nagamasa takatsuji(shonii-senior second rank),dainagon,shikibusho)(1515-1580)during the azuchi-momoyama period.
however,by the order of emperor gomizunoo in 1634,katsunaga takatsuji(shosanmi-senior third rank),sangi,okurasho(minister of treasury)(1600-1643)was adopted as the heir from the gojo family,which belonged to the same family,and the family name was revived.
their hereditary stipend during the edo period was 200 koku.
the family status held after the meiji period was viscount.
