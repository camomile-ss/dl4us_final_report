shiki(a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system)
shiki was a rank in government offices under the ritsuryo system.
summary
shiki was an organization to take charge of clerical work along with ryo(ritsuryo system)and tsukasa(also known as shi)and to rule special areas(like kyoto),mainly under the ministries(two ministries of nakatsukasasho and kunaisho).
shiki was ranked higher than ryo and tsukasa and relatively independent of higher organizations.
shitokan,the regular officials,were called daibu(kami)-suke-jo-sakan.
since togubo and shiki had completely the same configuration of shitokan,corresponding court ranks and the like,togubo is considered to have been a kind of shiki.
shiki can be classified further into two ranks according to the court ranks of the officials and the like.
