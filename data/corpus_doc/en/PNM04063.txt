hisakuni awataguchi
hisakuni awataguchi(dates of birth and death unknown)was a sword craftsman in kamakura period.
son of kuniie awataguchi,the founder of the awataguchi school.
born as the second son of a sword craftsman family.
along with his brothers kunitomo,kunikiyo,kunuyoshi,arikuni,and kunitsuna awataguchi,they are called awataguchi six brothers.
hisakuni was appointed as gobankaji by the retired emperor gotoba,and was especially given a grand master class '師徳鍛冶.'
his azana(adult male's nickname)was tojiro.
he was given the title of osumi no kuni gon no kami(provisional governor of osumi province).
he was the first sword craftsman who was given a zuryomei(honorary titles).
in a sword instruction "kaihokenjaku" written in 1830 in the edo period, 'hisakuni' is listed as the best old sword in terms of its artistic value.
however,even at that time the sword was very rare and the sharpness was not tried like other old swords,so the sharpness of the sword is unknown.
among the existing swords,one is designated as a national treasure,and three are designated as important cultural properties.
in roppongi,tokyo prefecture,there is a shrine 'hisakuni-jinja shrine' which was named so because dokan ota donated a sword made by hisakuni.
