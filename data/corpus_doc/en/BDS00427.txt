the first tango daibutsu
it seems that it was made by bronze and as high as the present one(for the lack of image of the first daibutsu,details are unclear).
1917:the 42 employees who went on a trip for an excursion to tokyo were killed by the flu.
from 1917 to around 1920:the factory manager himself built the daibutsu at honzaka,ine-cho,yosa-gun(since there is no record,this time is very obscure).
1944:it was scrapped unfortunately for having been made of metal.
it seems that it was cast into bullets for the war.
the second tango daibutsu
1945:it was built at the same place of the first tango daibutsu.
after that,it continues to exist to this day.
access
since there is no public transportation,there is no way to reach it,except by car.
