taisha
taisha are large jinja(shinto shrines),or one of the 492 jinja categorized as shikinai taisha in the early heian period text jimmyocho(the list of deities)of engishiki(codes and procedures on national rites and prayers),or those jinja that have adopted the suffix taisha.
it was once the case that the characters of the word 'taisha,' pronounced 'oyashiro,' referred specifically to izumo taisha shrine(izumo city,shimane prefecture).
after the second world war,a large number of old kampei taisha(great imperial shrines)and kokuhei taisha(great national shrines)changed their titles to simply taisha.
examples are given below.
