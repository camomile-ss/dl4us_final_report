history
in 1599,the year after his death,hideyoshi toyotomi's remains were buried at the summit of mt.amidagamine near hoko-ji temple in accordance with his will,and toyokuni-jinja shrine originated from the mausoleum that was constructed to serve as the guardian shrine of hoko-ji temple at the foot of the mountain.
emperor goyozei granted the shrine the rank of shoichii(senior first rank)and bestowed upon the deity the name hokoku daimyojin in a lavish enshrinement festival.
however after the destruction of the hashiba clan in 1615,the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)revoked this name and confiscated the shrine's land,after which the shrine buildings fell into decay and the sacred object within the shrine was secretly relocated to ima hie-jinja shrine.
emperor meiji proclaimed the restoration of toyokuni-jinja shrine during a visit to osaka in 1868 when it was deemed that hideyoshi toyotomi was a loyal retainer who revered the emperor,united the nation and did not establish the bakufu.
toyokuni-jinja shrine was classified as a bekkaku kanpeisha(a special government shrine)in 1873.
in 1880,the construction of a shrine building was completed at the site on which the great buddha of hoko-ji temple once stood and the shrine was relocated.
