fujiwara no michimoto(okura-kyo)
fujiwara no michimoto(1090-november 29,1148)was a nobleman during the late heian period.
he was the second son of the chinju fu shogun(commander-in-chief of the defense of the north)fujiwara no motoyori.
his mother was a daughter of fujiwara no kuninaka from chikuzen province.
he was awarded the rank of shoshii(senior fourth rank),and served in noto province,okura-sho(ministry of the treasury),and kyoshiki(the capital bureau).
he was also known as michimoto jimyoin.
during the tenji era,motomichi renovated and expanded the jimyo-in temple,which had been founded by his father motoyori as his jibutsu-do hall(a private buddha statue hall reserved for nobility),and changed the name to anrakuko-in.
he invited emperor toba to the renovated temple and held a grand scale memorial service.
afterwards, 'jimyo-in' remained as the name of the residence,and it became the yago(family name)of the house.
motomichi's third son motoie inherited the house,and his descendants prospered as the jimyo-in family of the house of urin.
