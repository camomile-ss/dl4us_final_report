isuzuyori hime no mikoto
according to "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan)and "kujihoongi" (ancient japanese history),isuzuhime no mikoto,also called isuzuyorihime(date of birth and death unknown)was a wife of emperor suizei,a daughter of kotoshironushi-no-kami(her mother's name is unknown)and a mother of emperor annei.
her older sister,himetatara isuzuhimenomikoto,became a wife of emperor jinmu.
as she was one of kesshi-hachidai(eight undocumented sovereigns),there is a theory that she was nonexistent,same as her husband emperor suizei.
according to annei-ki in nihonshoki,there is a description that isuzuyorihime no mikoto was a beloved daughter of kotoshironushi-no-kami.
this matched the description in suizei-ki二年条 "(emperor suizei,a father of emperor annei)took isuzuyori hime for his wife as empress,that is,she was a mioba(a sister of the wife)of emperor."
in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters),isuzuyorihime no mikoto does not appear,but kawamatabime appears as a wife of emperor suizei.
