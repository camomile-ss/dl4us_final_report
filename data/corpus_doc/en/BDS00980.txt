ancient records indicate the horinden was brought to japan by the monk ennin.
it is reported that the work was distributed widely during the reign of the tang dynasty.
however,newly published historical accounts,such as the "keitokuden toroku," were introduced the northern song period and as they were included in daizo-kyo sutra(the tripitaka),the importance of the horinden declined rapidly,and finally they were dispersed and lost.
