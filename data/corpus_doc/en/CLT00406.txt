tencha(powdered green tea)
tencha is a kind of steamed green tea.
it's a raw material for maccha(powdered green tea).
like gyokuro(refined green tea),tencha is made from tea leaves grown shielded from the sunlight before being harvested,which are then steamed and dried in tencha-ro(a special furnace for tencha).
unlike sencha(normal green tea),its manufacturing process has no kneading(rolling)of tea leaves so that they're similar in shape to aonori(green lavers).
it has a moderate aroma of its own,like gyokuro,because the tea leaves are covered to shut out the sunlight before harvesting.
maccha(powdered green tea)is made by grinding this tencha in a stone mill.
it is preserved in chatsubo(a tea canister),which is also called hachatsubo(a canister for tea leaves).
there is another tencha--a kind of chinese tea--that is different from the japanese tencha of this subject.
