his father mitsushige,who is a son of minamoto no mitsunobu from mino-genji(minamoto clan),was later adopted by minamoto no nakamasa.
he is described as a close blood relative of minamoto no yorimasa in "heiji monogatari" (the tale of the heiji),and it is said that he guided minamoto no yoshitsune(rushanao)for direction together with kichiji kaneuri from oshu(northern honshu,the region encompassing mutsu and dewa provinces)when yoshitsune escaped from mt.kurama to togoku(the eastern part of japan,particularly kanto region),and that he invited yoshitsune to his own domain in shimofusa province to shelter him for about a year.
a story similar to "heiji monogatari" is included in the article about yoshitsune in "sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy),which describes that 'yoshitsune talked with a traveler from togoku(the eastern part of japan,particularly kanto region)named shoryo no suke shigeyori(yorishige)and let him promise to accept his request at kurama-dera temple.'
