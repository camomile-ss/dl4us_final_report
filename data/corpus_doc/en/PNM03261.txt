ekan
ekan(date of birth and death unknown)was a buddhist priest who came to japan from goguryeo in the nara period.
he was the founder of the sanron sect.
ekan learned the san-lun teachings from yoshizo.
in 625,the king of goguryeo sent ekan to japan and he spread the teachings of sanron sect and had the imperial order to live in the ganko-ji temple.
one view states that he became the highest ranked monk by preaching the three shastras when people suffered from drought in the summer of that year,whereas others believe it was emperor kotoku who offered him the position.
he later built the ikami-ji temple in kawachi district and spread the teachings of sanron sect.
after that,his teachings were passed on to fukuryo and chizo.
chizo moved to china to learn the san-lun teachings and lived in the horyu-ji temple after he came back.
then teachings were passed on to doji who moved to china and learned the san-lun teachings and lived in daian-ji temple after he came back.
