fujiwara no chikanari
fujiwara no chikanari(or chikanori,yoshichika,yochiakira,arachi)(788-octover 16,843)was a politician in the imperial court at the beginning of the heian period.
he was the eighth son of fujiwara no uchimaro.
his mother was a daughter of daishin yoritsune.
his official ranks were shosanmi(senior third rank),shikibu no taifu(senior assistant minister of the ministry of ceremonial),dainagon(chief councilor of state)and sangi(councilor).
he played a central role in the close retainers group as the father of imperial prince tsunesada's wife in the imperial court during the reign of emperor ninmyo.
by this reason,he gradually deepened the political confrontation between fujiwara no yoshifusa,his nephew who aimed to put up the imperial prince michiyasu(later the emperor montoku).
when the jowa incident occurred in 842,fujiwara no yoshimi,yoshifusa's brother,led his guardsmen and surrounded the residence of imperial prince tsunesada.
chikanari,who worked there,was arrested as a rebel with fujiwara no yoshino and funya no akitsu.
and as a result of the deliberation,he was exiled to the countryside of kyoto and never came back to the political arena.
yoshifusa was assigned to dainagon after chikanari,and began to take this opportunity to solidify the foundation of his power.
