ko no morofuyu
ko no morofuyu(?-february 21,1351)was a busho(military commander)in the period of the northern and southern courts(japan).
morofuyu was a son of ko no moroyuki and a cousin of ko no moronao(later he was adopted by moronao).
his official court ranks were harima no kuni no kami(governor of harima province)and mikawa no kuni no kami(governor of mikawa province).
morofuyu served takauji ashikaga as did his cousin moronao.
receiving the order from takauji,morofuyu set out the conquest of kanto region in 1338 and completed by the winter of 1343.
thanks to the contribution,he was appointed first as the constable of musashi province and then as the constable of iga province.
he also worked hard for the memorial service of tenryu-ji temple in 1345.
when motouji ashikaga,a son of takauji,was sent to kanto region as the kamakura kubo(governor-general of the kanto region),morofuyu and noriaki uesugi cooperated to support young motouji.
however,when conflict between his cousin moronao and tadayoshi ashikaga broke out in kyoto,morofuyu also came to conflict with noriaki uesugi on the tadayoshi's side.
although morofuyu left kamakura and escaped into susawa-jo castle of kai prefecture(present-day minami-alps city,yamanashi prefecture)at the end of 1350 after the setback in the conflict,he was soon besieged by the force of the suwa clan,giving up running away,and killed himself on february 21,1351.
