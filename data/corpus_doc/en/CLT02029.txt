traditional vegetables
traditional vegetables are vegetables of native varieties that have been cultivated in various places since the ancient times.
they are also called local vegetables.
because of costs associated with production,distribution and sales,they have been rarely cultivated for shipment to mass-consumption areas since the 1970s.
one of the strategies used in recent years is to take the indigenous varieties of vegetables,which had been grown solely for the farmer's own consumption,and incorporate them into the local market to reinvigorate the producer areas,sell them to neighboring cities as local produce,and ship them to metropolitan areas as "slow-food" products.
