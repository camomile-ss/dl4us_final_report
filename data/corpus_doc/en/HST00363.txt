rihooki
rihooki(also referred to as ribuoki)was the diary of imperial prince shigeakira,the fourth son of emperor godaigo,and is regarded as an important historical document for understanding the administrative affairs and rituals of the imperial court during the mid heian period.
the name of the diary derives from 'riho,' the chinese equivalent of shikibu,which was the highest position(shikibukyo[minister of the ministry of ceremonial])that imperial prince sigeakira held in the court during his lifetime.
the title and its rendering in chinese characters of the document varies greatly,including; "rihooki" (李部王記), "rihoki" (吏部記), "rihoki" (李部記), "shigeakira shinnoki" (重明親王記), "shigeakiraki" (重明記),and "juki" (重記).

the earliest possible date for the diary's last entry is said to be april 14,953;however,as this is a date one year and a half prior to the death imperial prince shigeakira(the imperial prince passed away on october 18,954),the possibility that which he did not make any entries in his diary during this period may be significantly low(morosuke fujiwara,who was a court noble contemporary with imperial prince and also his farther-in-law,made entries in his diary until two days before his death).
(the details can be found in the article on "kyureki" [the diary of fujiwara no morosue]).
in "hokuzansho" (a representative book of ceremonies for the heian period written by fujiwara no kinto),there is a mention of 'the chrysanthemum contest of the year 953 recorded in the diary of kenrihoo(imperial prince shigeakira)' (a parenthetical reference by the author),and it is known that the imperial event of the chrysanthemum contest in 953 was held on november 23(according to "kokonchomonju" [a collection of tales heard,past and present]).
