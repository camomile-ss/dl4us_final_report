gyoen
gyoen(the dates of his birth and death are unknown)was a monk in the mid-heian period.
he was from kyushu.
although he had been a hunter in early adulthood,one day after shooting dead a stag that he came across when hunting,he saw a fawn appear out of the blood spurting from the animal's wound,and made up his mind to become a buddhist monk.
becoming a hijiri(a high-ranking priest)reciting the senju darani sutra,he built gyogan-ji temple(also called ko-do)on ichijo,kyoto in 1004.
basing himself at this temple,he held several meetings such as shiju-hachi ko(48 religious association),shaka ko(religious association of shkyamuni),shibu ko(literally,religious association of four parts),and gave people lectures about the hokke-kyo sutra(the lotus sutra).
he attracted many believers of a variety of rank,such as fujiwara no akinobu,a son of fujiwara no michinaga,who became a priest with gyoen as his mentor.
he also gathered a lot of people to remove stones from the road in awata in 1016.
he was called kawa-hijiri(hijiri wearing leather)or hisen(皮仙)(unworldly person wearing leather)because he always wore a buckskin.
he carved a statue of the kannon deity of mercy out of a keyaki(zelkova tree)at kamo-jinja shrine and enshrined it at gyogan-ji temple,and thus the temple was also called ko-do(temple built by kawa hijiri).
