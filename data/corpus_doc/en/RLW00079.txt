station layout
katsura station is an aboveground facility with three platforms serving six tracks;the station building is located on the bridge.
trains running on the kyoto line can pass superior trains at this station.
rapid express trains bound for kawaramachi station are comprised of ten cars(including two added cars)during the morning rush on weekdays;the additional cars are separated at this station.
the pedestrian deck on the east side is connected to the station building.
only track c is connected directly to the katsura train depot.
track c is used for the first local train bound for kawaramachi station on the kyoto line and as a railroad siding for deadhead trains.
incidentally,in the announcement track c is called the arashiyama line platform,like track 1(because there used to be through special express trains that would run between umeda station and arashiyama station on the kyoto line,which arrived at and departed from track c).
when the station was rebuilt,a platform was constructed for track c,which was originally a storage track of the katsura train depot located adjacent to the station;since then the platform has been referred to as platform c.
commercial construction
there is a commercial construction called 'mew hankyu katsura' at katsura station.
the commercial construction is operated with 'east' of the station building located on the east side of the station and 'west' comprising stores adjacent to the pedestrian deck on the west side of the station.

station surroundings
the katsura train depot
katsura imperial villa(approximately 600 meters from the station)
jizo-ji temple(kyoto city)(one of the pilgrimage to roku-jizo(six jizo)temples)
the kyoto katsura nishiguchi post office
the kyoto katsura post office
katsura elementary school,kyoto city
kawaoka elementary school,kyoto city
the streets around the station are narrow,but route buses still travel through the area.
additionally,the kawaoka(railway)crossing south of the station is situated between the streets,resulting in traffic congestion.
moreover,because the crossing gate comes down every time,not only commercial trains but also trains entering and leaving the rail yard pass the crossing,neighborhood residents have been requesting the elevation of the station;however,given the huge cost and the poor financial status of kyoto city it is uncertain whether the elevation will be realized.
under the circumstances,and to improve the situation,rakusaiguchi station was opened(at basically the same location as the old mozume station).

others
the station was used as a location for the shooting of a commercial for the lawson's pork cutlet box lunch(katsu-bento).
sanshi katsura and tomomi kahara were cast in the commercial.
in the commercial,a pun was made of 'cutlet' (katsu)and 'katsura.'
the type/destination information board installed on the platform for kawaramachi(platforms 2 and 3)is a rotatable-flap display,which differs from that of other stations in that a flap displaying 'for' is added to the name of the destination,such as 'limited express for kawaramachi.'
this display is an integration type that displays the first departure,which used to be found often in the old rotatable-flap displays of the hankyu railway(however,in the display,the flap 'rapid' (not in service)remains).
this type of rotatable-flap display is still used only at katsura station among the stations of the hankyu railway that still use rotatable-flap displays.)
meanwhile,the led display board and the lamp-stand type of display board are installed as type/destination information boards on the platform for osaka(platforms 4 and 5)and the arashiyama line platform(platforms c and 1),respectively,but those boards don't display 'for' as part of the destinations.
the manzai comedian duo "black mayonnaise" has a story related to katsura: 'despite my bald head,my name is kosugi(i.e.,thick hair).
i'm from katsura(i.e.,wig).
in fact,there is a place called katsura,in kyoto.'
