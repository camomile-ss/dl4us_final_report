sai(a unit of volume in old japanese system of weights and measures)
sai is a unit of volume(capacity)in old japanese system of weights and measures.
when sai is used as a unit for weighing a load of a ship or a building stone,1 sai is deemed to have the cubic volume of 1 shaku on a side(1 shaku is about 30.3 centimeters).
1 cubic shaku is roughly equal to 0.027826 cubic meters(27.876 liters)in the metric system.
in this case,10 times 1 sai(10 cubic shaku)is called 1 koku(a unit).
when sai is used as a unit for weighing lumber(especially valuable lumber),1 sai is deemed to have the volume of 1 sun square multiplied by 1 ken length or by 2 ken length in some regions of japan(1 sun is about 3.03 centimeters,and 1 ken is about 1.8182 meters).
provided 1 ken is equalized with 6 shaku,the volume is about 0.0016696 cubic meters.
besides,a 10th volume of 1 shaku,or a 1000th of 1 sho,is also called 1 sai.
1 sai here is equal to 10 futsu.
in this case,1 sai is set at 1.8039 milliliter.
