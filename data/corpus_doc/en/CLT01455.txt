chikyu
chikyu is a piece from gagaku(an ancient japanese court dance and music).
it is also known as 'enchiraku' or 'enikeraku.'
it is a dance performed by a team of four dancers and belongs to the uho(a style of japanese court dance and music,or the komagaku music).
it is a hira-mai dance(a slow-paced dance)utilizing koma-sojo(one of japanese chromatic scale based on a minor).
it involves wearing a kasane-shozoku costume(a costume for noh)and a mask,and uses a mushi(a piece of cloth)and a betsu-kabuto(chikyu-specific hat in the form of a phoenix).
it is a tsugaimai dance(a performance consisting of two pieces of dance)that involves either 'manjuraku' or 'bairo.'
it is believed that chikyu was performed together with the melody of 'sakurabito,' a song collected in saibara(a genre of the heian-period japanese court music,which primarily consists of gagaku-styled folk melodies).
there is a story of fujiwara no kinto singing 'sakurabito' of saibara while rhythmically tapping a pillar with his fan at the shishinden hall(a hall for state ceremonies)around the prime season of the cherry blossoms,when o no masasuke and others,who were stationed at the guard tower,came out to the garden and danced the ha(the middle part)of 'chikyu.'
