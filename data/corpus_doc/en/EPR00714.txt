iokiiribiko no miko
iokiiribiko no miko was a member of the imperial family who lived during the kofun period(tumulus period).
he was the son of emperor keiko,and his mother was yasakairibine no mikoto.
other than emperor seimu as his older maternal half-brother,he had five younger maternal half-brothers,five younger maternal half-sisters,and 68 paternal half-brothers(of these,only 46 had their names handed down)such as yamato takeru no mikoto.
it is described in nihonshoki(chronicles of japan)that his father,emperor keiko,confined his princes to each of their provinces and counties,except for the three princes,iokiiribiko no miko,seimu,and yamato takeru no mikoto.
among them,since yamato takeru no mikoto was sent to an expedition against kumaso(a tribe living in the ancient kyushu district),iokiiribiko no miko was considered as a reserve in case something happened to emperor seimu.
homudamawaka no miko(the father of nakatsuhime no mikoto,who was the empress of emperor ojin)was his child.
