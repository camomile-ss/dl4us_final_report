shamichoro
shamichoro is a japanese specter that is introduced in "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (one hundred bags in idleness),a collection of specters illustrations by sekien toriyama.
it is pointed out as one of the creations of sekien.
it is a type of tsukumo-gami(gods to a variety of things),and it is considered that a samisen(a three-stringed japanese banjo)which had once been used by a master player had transformed into a specter after being thrown away.
according to the explanatory note on shamichoro by sekien in "hyakki tsurezure bukuro",an old proverb "you cannot become a choro(senior monk)from a shami" is mentioned which means a higher rank cannot be achieved without following the proper sequence.
shami which is mentioned here means men who have not become buddhist monk even if they have become a priest,and choro means kokushichoro who were the greatest of all buddhist monks at the time.
in other words,the theory holds that it takes many years for a samisen to become a shamichoro,just as it takes a long time and sufficient training for a shami to become a choro.
