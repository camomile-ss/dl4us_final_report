nenshaku
the term nenshaku means the right to confer a court rank on a person that was granted to chiten no kimi(the retired emperor in power)and sangu(the three empresses:great empress dowager,empress dowager and empress)in japan's ancient/early medieval period.
each of the chiten and sangu was given every year the right to confer a court rank on one person and allowed to confer the jugoi(junior fifth rank)on one of the applicants in return for a payment of joryo(a fee for attaining a court rank).
this system started in the early heian period and later,the privilege of nenshaku was also granted to nyoin(close female relatives of the emperor or a woman of comparative standing)and jugo(honorable rank next to the three empresses).
this system was originally the sale of court rank,like the system of eishaku under which temples/shrines and guji(chief of those who serves shrine)were conferred court ranks in return for a payment of joryo.
in the end of the heian period and the kamakura period however,shojo(promotion)(kakai(promotion))using the nenshaku system became popular.
