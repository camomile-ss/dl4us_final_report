fujiwara no kenshi
fujiwara no kenshi(kataiko)(1057-october 30,1084)was the chugu(empress)of the seventy-second emperor shirakawa.
her father was minamoto no akifusa,who held the title of udaijin(minister of the right),and her mother was minamoto no takako,who was the daughter of minamoto no takatoshi.
she was the adopted daughter of fujiwara no morozane,who held the title of daijo daijin(prime minister).
she underwent the judai(marriage to the emperor)to imperial prince sadahito(emperor shirakawa)on april 17,1071.
she became the nyogo(consort)as emperor shirakawa underwent the investiture of the crown on september 3,1073,and she became the chugu with the birth of her eldest child,imperial prince atsufumi on july 22,1074.
she lost imperial prince atsufumi on 1077 but gave birth to imperial prince yoshihito(emperor horikawa)in 1079.
she also gave birth to imperial princesses,teishi,(ikuhomon-in),reishi,and shinshi.
she passed away at the age of 28.
emperor shirakawa,whose favorite was kenshi,did not permit her to retire from the imperial court customs,and when she died,he cried heavily while cradling her dead body and lost his appetite.
when minamoto no toshiaki,who had the title of gon no chunagon(provisional middle councilor),saw this and suggested senko(departure of the emperor from the capital)since the emperor should not be touched by kegare(impurity),emperor shirakawa retorted while saying the famous anecdote, 'a practice is established by this case.'
even so,the grief of emperor shirakawa persisted,and he built enko-in temple in 1086 to bury her remains,made the buddha statue monthly,and built entoku-in temple,katsuraku-in temple,and jogyo-do hall and held a memorial service for her.
her mausoleum was kamidaigoryo mausoleum located in fushimi ward,kyoto city.
when the emperor horikawa ascended the throne,she was given the rank of empress dowager posthumously on january 30,1088.
