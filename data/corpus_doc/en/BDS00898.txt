inka(certification of achievement)
inka refers to the license which a master grants to a disciple who has mastered his teachings.
the written document issued as a certificate is called inkajo.
inka means the state of so-called "osumi-tsuki" (with endorsement).
in the zen sect,a disciple who was acknowledged as having attained enlightenment had his master's portrait drawn by a painter;the master then wrote his preaching on the portrait based on the style of chinese poetry called "gemon",and this portrait was used as a kind of diploma.
similarly,inka are given to pupils in martial arts(such as the art of swordmanship,spearmanship,and japanese traditional self-defense martial arts),sado(tea ceremony),sanjutsu(arithmetic),and the like.
some of the inkajo which remain today have been designated as national treasures and cultural properties.
