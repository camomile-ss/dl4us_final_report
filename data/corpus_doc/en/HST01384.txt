history
in the osaka conference held from january to february in 1875,toshimichi okubo and hirobumi ito who were working for the meiji government reached an agreement with takayoshi kido,taisuke itagaki,and kaoru inoue who were out of power,and it promised the return to the govenment for kido and itagak and the reform in political system.
in march of the same year,after kido and itagaki returned to the positions of sangi(councillors),they drew up a political reform plan together with okubo and ito based on the agreement in the osaka conference,and then submitted the plan to sanetomi sanjo,the daijo-daijin(the grand minister).
then,on april 14,a monjo(written material),which was prepared based on the political reform plan,was announced as a shosho by the emperor meiji.
that is the rikkenseitai no shosho.
although the shosho was untitled,it was referred to as 'rikkenseitai no shosho' in the table of contents in horei zensho(compendium of laws and regulations).
