history
the shimogamo-jinja shrine is one of the oldest shrines in kyoto.
according to legend,the enshrined deity descended at mt.mikage-yama during the reign of emperor jimmu.
there are records of the fence surrounding the honden(main hall)being repaired in bc 90 and some theories claim that the shrine may have been established around this time.
one theory even claims that this shrine was split from kamigamo-jinja shrine during the tempyo period.
along with kamigamo-jinja shrine,this shrine has been revered by the imperial court since before the nara period.
after the capital was relocated to heian,the shrine became even more highly revered by the imperial court and was granted the highest possible status,shoichii(senior first rank),in 807 with the kamo festival being held by royal order.
the jimmyocho(the list of deities)of the engishiki law ranks it as a myojin taisha(a grand shrine that enshrines a high-ranked deity)and states that received offerings at each festival such as the myojin-sai festival,tsukinami-sai festival,ainame-sai festival and niname-sai festival.
for approximately 400 years from 810,unmarried imperial princesses served as saiin and saio(priestesses)at the kamo-sha shrine.
