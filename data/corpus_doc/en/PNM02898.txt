career
in contrast to his father who served the southern court(of japan),ujitsuna defected from akiie kitabatake to takauji ashikaga when akiie attacked kamakura on the way to kyoto.
then,due to the military exploits he had achieved under takauji,in 1352 he was awarded the post of shugoshiki(a military governor)of kozuke province and echigo province,which were taken away from noriaki uesugi who had taken the side of tadayoshi ashikaga in the kanno disturbance,and served as a vassal of kamakura kubo(the governor-general of the kanto region),motouji ashikaga.
however,noriaki uesugi,who enjoyed great trust of motouji,was pardoned and asked for the return of the post of shugoshiki of kozuke and echigo provinces;as ujitsuna refused his request,motouji got angry,subjugated and deprived ujitsuna of his post of shugoshiki(in 1362).
after motouji died,ujitsuna,who was dissatisfied with the way he had been treated at the time,rebelled in 1368 taking advantage of the incident of musashiheiikki(a rebellion caused by a samurai group called heiikki)which occurred in musashi province;however,the rebellion was eventually subdued by motouji's son,ujimitsu ashikaga,and he surrendered.
he was spared his life,but on july 5,1370,died from a disease in the depths of despair at the age of 45,while he was fighting in kishu province.
