imperial prince kazurawara(december 1,786-july 17,853),a member of the imperial family in the heian period,was the founder of the taira clan.
his father was emperor kanmu.
his mother was tajihi no mahito mamune(sadako).
taira no takamune,taira no yoshimune and prince takami were his children.
known since childhood as a person of genius,imperial prince kazurawara,who was also a founder of the taira clan,celebrated his coming of age along with prince otomo(later emperor junna),a half-brother by the same father,in 789.
