history
the temple began as a tendai sect temple founded in the year 992 but the head priest in 1307 converted to the nichiren sect and changed the name of the temple to myosen-ji temple.
it was damaged in the tenbun hokke disturbance that broke out during the sengoku period(period of warring states)but was restored during the tensho era(1573-1592).
meanwhile,the nichiren sect danrin school(matsugasaki danrin)founded by nissho during the tensho era became honyu-ji temple and served as one of the places of study and training for the nichiren sect monks of kyoto.
myosen-ji temple and honyu-ji temple merged in 1918 to become the current yusen-ji temple.
