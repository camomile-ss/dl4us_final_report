settan-kaido road
the settan-kaido road was the principal road connecting settsu province and tanba province(present-day ikeda city,osaka prefecture,and kameoka city,kyoto prefecture,respectively).
the section of the road in nose district,settsu province,was also called yono-kaido road,while the section in tanba province was also called ikeda-kaido road.
until modern times,these roads were called 'ikeda-do road' and 'kameoka-do road,' respectively.
most of the section of this road has been re-developed by expansion construction for the road width,replacing or reducing the atmosphere of the old-days road and the roadside scenery.
only some signposts remained on the roadside indicate the past image and atmosphere of the old-days road.
the prefecture boundary mark placed by kyoto prefecture in 1934 still remains on the roadside at the boarder of osaka prefecture and kyoto prefecture.
most of the section of this road is designated as the national highway no.423,while some section in kameoka city is designated as the national highway no.372.
