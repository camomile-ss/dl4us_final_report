meike(important noble family)(kuge(court noble))
meike(also pronounced meika)was one of the kakaku(family status)of kuge(court noble)established after the kamakura period and it was of equal rank to the house of urin and positioned in a higher rank than hanke(a kind of family status of the court nobles)(kuge).
it was same as the house of urin in that dainagon(chief councilor of state)was kyokkan(the highest rank one could be appointed).
however,in the case of the house of urin,one was promoted to dainagon after the posts of military officers such as konoefu(the headquarters of the inner palace guards),while in the case of meike,one was promoted to chunagon(vice-councilor of state)and dainagon after the posts of civil officers and administrative officers such as jiju(a chamberlain)and benkan(a controller of the oversight department)(also served as kurodo(chamberlain)and kurodo no to(head chamberlain)at the same time).
as an exception,there were some people who were promoted to sadaijin(minister of the left)in the hino family,jun-daijin(vice minister)in the yanagihara family,naidaijin(minister of the center)in the karasumaru family and the madenokoji family.
in addition,in most cases,the starting rank was jiju in the hino line while it was emonfu(headquarters of the outer palace guards)in the kajuji line.
in the case of new families,one was appointed to benkan and he didn't served as kurodo at the same time,and depending on families,one was appointed to sangi(councillor)after the posts of shifunosuke(left and right divisions of the inner and the middle palace guards)and senior and junior assistants of hassho(eight ministries and agencies)in the middle of his career.
thus,families could have a difference in promotion.
at the end of edo period,there were a little less than thirty meike and most of them were families of the hino line of the fujiwara clan and the kajuji line of the fujiwara clan.
above all,the hino family,the hirohashi family,the karasumaru family,the yanagihara family,the takeya family,the uramatsu family,the kanroji family,the hamuro family,the kajuji family,the madenokoji family,the seikanji family,the nakanomikado family,the bojo family were called thirteen important noble families.
