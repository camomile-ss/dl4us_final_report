gojo-ohashi bridge
gojo-ohashi bridge is a bridge over the kamo-gawa river which runs through kyoto city,kyoto prefecture.
gojo-dori street(national route 1)runs on the bridge.
it is also on the boundary between shimogyo ward and higashiyama ward.
there is a great view of mt.hiei and other mountains from this bridge.
gojo-ohashi bridge is famous for the legendary story of musashibo benkei and minamoto no yoshitsune,and their stone statues in the style of a kyoto doll or kyo-ningyo(gosho-ningyo)stand in the green belt on the west side of the bridge close to the cross-section of kawaramachi-dori street and gojo-dori street.
however,gojo-dori street during the heian period has become the present matsubara-dori street,and one theory suggests the 'gojo-no-hashi' bridge of that time used to be near the present matsubara-bashi bridge,and another theory proposes that it was nishinotoin-dori street as no bridge was over the kamo-gawa river.
at the foot of gojo-ohashi bridge on the northwestern side stands ogizuka(literally,a fan mound)after the mieido(shinzenko-ji temple)fans that used be produced here.
underground at the east side of the bridge is gojo station(keihan)run by the keihan electric railway co.,ltd.
gojo-dori street extends eastward to gojo-zaka slope which leads to nishi-otani and kiyomizu-dera temple.
