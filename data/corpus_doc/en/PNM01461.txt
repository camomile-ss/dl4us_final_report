yamabuki gozen
yamabuki gozen was a binjo(beautiful maid)of minamoto no yoshinaka,a busho(japanese military commander)at the end of the heian period.
she accompanied him from shinano to kyo(the capital)along with tomoe gozen.
unable to move because of a disease,she could not accompany him when he was defeated.
some suggest that,like tomoe,she came from the clan of nakahara no kaneto.
chogoro kaionji,however,suggests that she came from the kanasashi clan,because the clan owned a castle called yamabuki-jo castle and suwa daimyojin ekotoba describes 'yoshinaka became a son-in-law of morizumi kanasashi,ohori(the chief priest)of suwa-jinja shrine shimo-sha,and had a daughter.'
