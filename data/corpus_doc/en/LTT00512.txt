takasebune(the boat on the river takase,a novel)
"takasebune" is ogai mori's short story.
it was published in january 1916 on "chuo koron," a magazine.
this story was based on 'runin no hanashi' (story of an exile)in 'okinagusa' (old man grass),a collection of essays in the edo period.
the theme of the story is a relation between the amount of property and desire,as well as the rights and wrongs of euthanasia.
story line
a man named kisuke who murdered his younger brother was on a boat on the takase-gawa river in kyoto that took kyoto criminals to a distant island.
shobe haneda,a police constable and an escort of kisuke,questioned him why he was smiling peacefully.
evaluation
ogai simultaneously published a self-commentary 'takasebune engi' which caused controversy about the theme of the story:whether it was to be satisfied with 'one's lot in life,' 'euthanasia,' or both.
a similar confusion existed in the relation between 'sansho dayu' sansho the bailiff)and his self-commentary 'rekishi sonomama to rekishi banare' (history as it is and history abandoned).
it was pointed out,however,that a criticism against the factory act was submerged in 'sansho dayu,' so that some considered ogai's self-commentaries to be deceptive means against censorship.
that means that 'marrying a wife from a wealthy merchant' was 'digit of an abacus,' a metaphor for the anglo-japanese alliance,and the theme of being satisfied with 'one's lot in life' could be a criticism of the 21 demands to china.
that is why 'takasebune' is now re-evaluated as a modern novel in the meiji period that was supported by the history of the time.
