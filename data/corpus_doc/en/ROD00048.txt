muromachi-dori street
the muromachi-dori street is one of the major north-south streets which run through kyoto city.
it corresponds to muromachi-koji street of heiankyo.
it is located immediately west of karasuma-dori street,along which a subway runs.
it extends from kitayama-dori street in the north to kuzebashi-dori street in the south.
the street is in the middle interrupted by higashi hongan-ji temple and kyoto station.
yoshimitsu ashikaga,the third shogun of ashikaga shogunate built his muromachi-dono(residence of ashikaga shogun family)admired as hana-no-gosho(residence of shogun in kyoto)near muromachi-dori imadegawa in 1378,which is the origin of the name muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
the street was busy as a political and cultural center until the collapse of the muromachi bakufu in onin war.
onin war devastated kyoto and divided it into two parts:kamigyo(the north part of capital)and shimogyo(south part of capital).
the muromachi-dori street is the only route connecting the two.
during the edo period,it developed as a wholesale street lined with kimono shops(drapers).
even today established shops that have been in business for hundreds of years stand side by side in a row.
in addition,in the gion festival,areas near shijo-muromachi crossing are the center of yamahokocho(towns with yama or hoko,float)where yamahoko,gion festival floats including kikusui-hoko,gion festival floats line up.
