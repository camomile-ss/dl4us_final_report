history
during the period from 1897 to 1902,wasuke kobayashi was a potato wholesaler in asakusa kotobuki-cho(present-day kotobuki,taito ward,tokyo).
to make good use of the waste potatoes that were difficult to dispose,he tried to make yokan(azuki-bean jelly)with different taste from bean jelly made with agar and sugar.
he approached to sadakichi,the second generation of japanese sweet shop 'funasada' in asakusa,and then 'imo-yokan' was completed by joint development.
afterwards,wasuke learned from sadakichi how to make imo-yokan.
he trained to become a skilled artisan of japanese sweets,and became independent by setting up a branch of the same shop to share the clientele.
wasuke founded 'funawa' in asakusa 1-chome,the name of which was made by taking one character from each of 'funasada' and 'wasuke.'
in addition,sadakichi and wasuke used a character of 'fune' because two came from funabashi-cho(the current funabashi city,chiba prefecture).
then,sadakichi moved to ashikaga-cho(present-day ashikaga city,tochigi prefecture)with his family,and thus 'funasada' moved to ashikaga.
nowadays,imo-yokan has spread all over japan,and is familiar as a special product of sweet potato production areas such as kawagoe city,saitama prefecture.
