nobufusa madenokoji
nobufusa madenokoji(1258-november 11,1348)was a court noble during the kamakura period to the period of the northern and southern courts.
his father was sukemichi madenokoji.
his children were fujifusa madenokoji and suefusa madenokoji.
he was initially named michitoshi.
he worked during the reigns of emperor kameyama and emperor godaigo of daikakuji-to(imperial lineage starting with emperor kameyama),and he was appointed kurodo(chamberlain)and promoted to kurodo no to(head chamberlain)and sangi(councillor).
in 1324,during the shochu disturbance when the anti-shogunate plot by emperor godaigo was uncovered,he went to kamakura himself to defend the emperor's action.
thereafter,he was promoted to dainagon(chief councilor of state).
during the genko war,he was retained by rokuhara tandai(an administrative and judicial agency in rokuhara,kyoto),because his two sons were involved in the anti-shogunate movement.
after the fall of the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),he was promoted to juichii(junior first rank)in the kenmu restoration,and then held responsibility as tonin(the director)for zasso-ketsudansho(agency of kenmu government to file lawsuits).
this same year(1336)he was forced to join priesthood along with tadaaki chigusa.
his son,fujifusa,also was forced to retire for criticizing the system of rule by the emperor.
for this reason,when takauji ashikaga followed emperor godaigo,nobufusa remained in kyoto with the young bereaved child of suefusa(suefusa was killed at his place of exile during the fall of the kamakura bakufu).
the madenokoji family,which had held power in the daikakuji-to for many years,became active as the kuge of jimyoin-to(imperial lineage from emperor gofukakusa to emperor gokomatsu)(the northern court).
he was called one of the 'nochi no sanbo(three attendants to emperor with the word 'fusa' attached to their names)' along with other personal attendants to emperor godaigo,chikafusa kitabatake and sadafusa yoshida.
nobufusa wrote a diary called "madenokoji ipponki," of which a fragment still remains.
leaving behind a diary was considered,at the time,a requirement for court nobles as a means of leaving behind a reference to duties to be performed by court nobles and for the descendants who would carry on the family name;therefore,his father,sukemichi,who was given a leisurely post,did not write a diary.
therefore,duties of kuge left in the madenokoji family were written by nobufusa,and he was respected as the head of the madenokoji family.
