nobuna oinomikado
nobuna oinomikado(1699-november 20,1684)was a retainer of the imperial court in the early edo period.
he mainly served emperor reigen(the 112th),and his official court rank culminated at sakone no chujo(middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards)of shoshiinoge(senior fourth rank,lower grade).
his father was dajodaijin(grand minister)motohiro konoe.
his mother was unknown.
his foster father was sadaijin(minister of the left)tsunetaka oinomikado.
his brother,iehiro konoe,was kanpaku(chief advisor to the emperor),and his older sister and younger sister were hiroko konoe(consort of ienobu tokugawa)and the consort of imperial prince kaninnomiya naohito,respectively.
he was born as the second son of the konoe family.
the heir apparent of the oinomikado family became empty as the biological child of tsunetaka oinomikado was adopted by a person named gikyo naito and called himself giryu naito,although detailed circumstances concerning adoption are unavailable.
as a result,nobuna was adopted by the oinomikado family because he was a child born out of wedlock.
however,he passed away in 1684.
he died at the age of 16.
the head of the oinomikado family was succeeded by the child of giryu naito,tsunenari oinomikado,who was adopted by the oinomikado family.
