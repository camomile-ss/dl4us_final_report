mohei murai
mohei murai(june 10,1821-may 1873)was a wealthy merchant from the morioka domain.
his yago(pen-name)was kagiya.
he was also known as kagiya mohei.
mohei's property was confiscated in the scandal of osarizawa copper mine.
the new meiji government was gradually taking over foreign loans of former domains,and the debts of the morioka domain were the largest of all.
on the august 28,1871,mohei's private property,including mining rights of the copper mine,was confiscated following a mistaken government audit of the morioka domain and mohei.
mohei protested,but with the systems not yet complete,and the single judgement of the government office not being overturned,the mining rights were handed to heizo okada,a friend of inoue kaoru.
mohei did not give up pursuit of legal action,and the case was used by sympathizers of eto shinpei,the then minister of justice who was rallying against inoue kaoru,to make the public aware of corruption.
burdened with the debts of the morioka domain,mohei was a victim of the inerrancy of government officials.
