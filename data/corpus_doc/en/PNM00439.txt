leaving from a deep forest,in unfamiliar village,a little cuckoo is calling in restlessly(kinyo wakashu)
at the foot of the mountain,wind in the grass,deer are calling,they may be waiting for fall(kinyo wakashu)
my love is like a letter written on the feather,nobody knows my love until transferring it to something(kinyo wakashu)
i heard my sweetheart voice in the shadows,that night my sleeve got wet with tears as like wet with dew(kinyo wakashu)
pink flowers of which i planted seeds are in full bloom,how many times i've checked them with morning dew(shika wakashu)
darkness in may,lights in the mountain peaks look like stars behind the clouds(senzai wakashu)
in the evening,my heart gets lost a place to go,there is no path for love(senzai wakashu)
every curtain of spring rain mist,making leaf buds come into,making flower buds burst(shin chokusen wakashu)
