yasutoshi wakizaka
yasutoshi wakizaka(1618-march 11,1636)was a successor of the shinano iida domain,shinano province.
he was the second son of masayoshi hotta,who was a hatamoto(a direct retainer of the shogun).
his mother was a daughter of masanari inaba.
he was adopted by the lord yasumoto wakizaka after yasutsune wakizaka,who was the first lord of shinano iida domain,was killed in a sword fight in 1632.
he however died in 1636 at the age of 19 before he took over the headship of the family.
as a replacement,yasumasa wakizaka,who was the second son of masamori hotta,yasutoshi's older brother,and also the lord of the kawagoe domain in musashi province,and who was therefore yasutoshi's nephew,was adopted and became yasumoto's legitimate son.
