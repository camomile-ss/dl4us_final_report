the ayanokoji family was a member of genji tosho genji(minamoto clan members who are court nobles above a certain rank),descendants of uda-genji(minamoto clan).
its patriarch was nobuari ayanokoji(shonii-senior second rank),chunagon(vice-councilor of state)(1269-1324),a descendant of sadaijin(minister of the left)minamoto no masanobu.

the highest court rank originally appointed was chunagon.
the family ended after toshikazu ayanokoji(shonii,chunagon)(1451-1518)from the sengoku period(period of warring states)(japan).
in 1613,takaari ayanokoji(shosanmi-senior third rank),sangi-councilor)(1595-1644)joined the family from the gojo family,and the family name was revived.
after toshimune ayanokoji(1690-1770),the highest court position appointed was dainagon(chief councilor of state).
