history
the original form of mitsumame was a confectionery for children made of red peas in a boat of shinkozaiku(a kind of rice cake)with molasses poured on,at the end of the edo period.
it is said that mitsumame in today's form was sold for the first time in 1903 by 'funawa' in asakusa.
it consisted of red peas,cubes of agar gelatin,apricot,and mochi(rice cake)contained in a silver bowl with molasses poured on top.
funawa served mitsumame at a western teahouse named 'mitsumame hall' following the name of 'beer hall' and 'milk hall' which were popular at that time,creating favorable attention as sweets for adults.
in 1930,an oshiruko(sweet red-bean soup with pieces of rice cake)shop 'wakamatsu' located in the ginza launched anmitsu which was a mitsumame with bean jam on it.
