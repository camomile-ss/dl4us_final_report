although it's often incorrectly considered to be the station nearest to kurama-dera temple,kurama is nearly 10 km northward from this station(as the crow flies)and no bus line connecting to kurama is available.
the station's name derives from karasuma-kuramaguchi,which is the crossing of karasuma-dori street and kuramaguchi-dori street,and kuramaguchi,which is one of the "kyo-no-nanakuchi" (seven entrances of kyoto),is located at the west end of izumoji-bashi bridge(kuramaguchi-cho,kita ward),about 500m east of the station.
to reach kurama,it's convenient to transfer at kokusaikaikan station of the karasuma line because passengers can go on foot to iwakura station(kyoto prefecture)or hachiman-mae station(kyoto prefecture)of the kurama line,which is operated by the eizan electric railway co.,ltd.
under such circumstances,an announcement saying, 'passengers going to kibune/kurama,please get off at kokusaikaikan station,' is made on the trains bound for kokusaikaikan of the karasuma line before their arrival at this station.
