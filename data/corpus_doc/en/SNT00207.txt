nyakuichioji
"nyakuichioji" is a god(shinto)from syncretism of shinto and buddhism.
it is also called nyakuoji.
kumano gongen,enshrined in kumano sanzan(three major shrines,kumano-hongu-taisha,kumano-hayatama-taisha and kumano-nachi-taisha),are categorized as sansho gongen(three deities),gosho oji(five deities),and shisho myojin(four deities),and nyakuichioji is the first of the gosho oji.
the honji-butsu(original buddhist divinity)of nyakuichioji is the eleven-faced kannon(goddess of mercy),and was equated with amaterasu omikami(the sun goddess)or ninigi.
it is enshrined in the fourth hall in kumano-hongu-taisha shrine and kumano-hayatama-taisha shrine,and the fifth hall in the kumano-nachi-taisha-shrine(both are called 'wakamiya' today,and are believed to be amaterasu omikami).
along with the spread of kumano belief nationwide,kanjo(ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location)of kumano gongen occurred in various locations,but in many cases,kanjo of nyakuichioji alone were performed.
many places changed 'nyakuichioji' to amaterasu omikami or ninigi in response to the separation of buddhism and shintoism,but some shrines continue to enshrine 'nyakuichioji.'
