the original forefather was kanehira takatsukasa,the fourth son of iezane konoe of the konoe family,which was the main line of the house of fujiwara north of the fujiwara clan,in the mid-kamakura period.
the family name was derived from takatsukasa street in heian-kyo(the kanehira family was in takatsukasa-muromachi).
during the edo period the stipend was 1000 koku,but later it was 1500 koku.
the family was ranked as a prince after the meiji restoration.

during the sengoku period(the warring states period)(japan),the family line failed once in the generation of tadafuyu takatsukasa,but in the early edo period nobufusa takatsukasa,the son of haruyoshi nijo,restored the takatsukasa family,which continued to exist until the modern age.
in 1743,sukehira takatsukasa(imperial prince kaninnomiya naohito)inherited the takatsukasa family.
from the late edo period to the end of the edo shogunate period,the family heads of the house of takatsukasa frequently became senior regents,and in particular masamichi takatsukasa served as a senior regent for 30 years.from the late edo period to the end of the edo shogunate period,the heads of the takatsukasa family frequently became senior regents,and in particular masamichi takatsukasa served as a senior regent for 30 years.
because takako takatsukasa,the daughter of nobufusa,became a legitimate wife of iemitsu tokugawa,her younger brother nobuhira takatsukasa was allowed to refer to himself as being of the takatsukasa-matsudaira family,and he changed his social status from a court noble who served the emperor to a hatamoto(a direct vassal of the shogun)of the tokugawa family;the takatsukasa family,a samurai family,had been promoted over generations and ultimately became the house of the lord of the domain of yoshii,in kozuke province.
