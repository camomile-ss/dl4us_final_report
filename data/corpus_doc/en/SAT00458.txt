history
this district used to be called ''sakurada'' (cherry blossom field),noted for its cherry blossoms,and it is said the shrine once held a territory of several hundred square meters.
it fell into ruin following the meiji restoration,and it is said that most of the nearly 200 families and priests departed,leaving behind nothing but mud walls,tatsuo hori and other writers expressed sorrows in their literary works.
the shrine was restored by local volunteers saddened by the situation,and they merged tenmangu shrine with benzaiten shrine and placed it to the left of ako-jinja shrine to bring the two shrines together on the same site.
since 1930,it has existed as a detached shrine of nanto kagami-jinja shrine,which is located near yakushi-ji temple.
