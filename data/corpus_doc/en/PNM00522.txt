norizane kujo
norizane kujo(1211-april 24,1235)was a court noble during the middle of the kamakura period.
his father was michiie kujo.
his mother was rinshi who was a daughter of kintsune saionji.
his younger brothers were yoshizane nijo who was the founder of the nijo family,sekke shogun(shogun from a regent family),and sanetsune ichijo who was the founder of the ichijo family.
he was called toin sessho.
when the third shogun minamoto no sanetomo was assassinated in 1219 and the blood line of the minamoto family died out,he was seen as a candidate for shogun because his parents were on minamoto no sanetomo's mother's side,but he established the kujo family because his younger brother yoritsune became shogun.
in 1227 he became udaijin(minister of the right)and in 1231 sadaijin(minister of the left),in the same year he inherited kanpaku,ujichoja(chief adviser to the emperor,chieftain of the family)from his father,but the real power was wielded by his father michiie.
in 1232 when emperor shijo ascended to the throne,he assumed the post of regent.
after that,on september in 1233,empress sonshi kujo died,and on august in the following year emperor gohorikawa(father of emperor shijo)died as well,which was considered to be due to the grudge of emperor gotoba who was the uncle of the retired emperor gohorikawa according to rumors.
for this reason,he consulted with the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)in 1235 so that cloistered emperor gotoba,who had been exiled to oki province,could come back to the capital kyoto,but this ended up in failure and he died in march in the same year.
