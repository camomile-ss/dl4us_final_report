yoshifusa ishido(date of birth and death unknown)was a military commander in the period of the northern and southern courts(japan).
his posthumous buddhist name was shukei(or gikei nyudo).

yoshifusa was dismissed in the following year and dispatched to mutsu province as the supreme commander of oshu where he stayed until 1345,during which overwhelmed the southern court(japan)including the date clan,akinobu kitabatake,etc.and successfully organized the ou region.
however,yoshifusa was dismissed by takauji ashikaga because he acquired a stronger tendency to rule on his own.

yoshifusa was appointed to shugo(provincial constable)of izu province and kai province by tadayoshi.
in the end of 1351,he was defeated in the battle of mt.satta in suruga province.
after the death of tadayoshi,yoshifusa belonged to the side of tadafuyu ashikaga,conspired with yoshioki nitta and yoshimune nitta,and experienced many campaigns in the direction of kinai region.
however,soon he was overwhelmed by takauji and had been deteriorated.
after takauji seized kyoto in 1355,yoshifusa disappeared without any trace.
