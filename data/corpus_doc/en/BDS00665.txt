kakujo
kakujo(1521-february 4,1574)was a buddhist priest of the tendai sect who lived during the sengoku period(period of warring states)(japan).
he served as tendai-zasu(the head priest of the tendai sect).
his father was emperor gonara.
his mother was iyo no tsubone,the daughter of masahisa mibu.
he entered the buddhist priesthood at manshu-in monzeki temple(temple formerly led by founder of sect,temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family)of enryaku-ji temple in 1525,and he inherited manshu-in monzeki temple in 1527.
he was called konrenin jugo(honorary rank next to the three empresses:great empress dowager,empress dowager,and empress)by the imperial proclamation of jusangu(same as jugo)in 1557.
in 1570,he became the 166th tendai-zasu amid the chaos of the sengoku period(japan).
in the following year,1571,he escaped from danger of the fire attack against mt.hiei by nobunaga oda(in 1571)because he was not on mt.hiei at that time.
however,he exiled himself relying on shingen takeda in kai province because he was pursued for his responsibility for the resistance on mt.hiei.
later,he made an effort for shingen to attain the soi(rank of buddhist priest)of gon no sojo(the provisional lower priest in the highest position).
he died in 1574 without returning to kyo(kyoto)after that.
