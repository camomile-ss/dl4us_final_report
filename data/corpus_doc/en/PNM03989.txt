"sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy)says he was the seventh son and an elder brother of taira no masatame;however,according to "hitachi no daijo fu," he was masatame's younger brother.
he was masakado shiju izu no kami(governor of izu province).
summary
according to 'the article of november 3,938' of "honcho seiki" (chronicle of imperial reigns),a warrant to search and capture masatake was issued in four provinces of suruga,izu,kai and sagami,which tells that masatake had been exerting overwhelming influence based in izu and sagami before masakado launched the johei and tengyo war.
when masakado started to call himself 'the new emperor,' masatake was appointed to izu no kami;however,his power declined at a stretch after masakado died in the battle with taira no sadamori and fujiwara no hidesato on march 30,940,and eventually,masatake was also killed.
in april 22,940,hieki(communication envoy)of kai province reported that masatake was killed to the imperial court.
