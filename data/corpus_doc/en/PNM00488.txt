saneki sanjonishi
saneki sanjonishi(september 6,1511-march 1,1579)was a court noble,poet and classical scholar during the sengoku period(period of warring states).
he was first named saneyo,changing to sanezumi at the age of 34 and saneki at the age of 64.
his homyos(dharma names)were goku and genkaku.
he went by the pseudonym,sankoin.
his held the office of naidaijin(minister of the center)and was awarded the rank of shonii(senior second rank).
his father was kineda sanjonishi.
his mother was the daughter of motonaga kanroji.
he married a woman from the hatakeyama clan.
his son was kinkuni sanjonishi.
his grandson was saneeda sanjonishi.
in 1544,he lost both his oldest son,kinyo sanjonishi,and his wife.
in 1552,he left kyoto and moved to suruga province.
in 1569,after he returned to kyoto,he worked tirelessly on interpreting classical literature,publishing 'yamashitamizu' (commentary on the 'tale of genji')that was handed down in the sanjonishi family.
in 1577,nobunaga oda appointed him dainagon(chief councilor of state)(during this period it was customary to appoint gon dainagons(provisional chief councilor of state)and the post of dainagon was left opened,but saneki was appointed dainagon after the post had been vacant for 23 years.)
the kokin denju(the secret transmissions of the "kokinshu",anthology of old and new japanese poems)that was handed down for generations in the sanjonishi family was to be taught to only one child in the family;however because his son,kinkuni was too young,saneki taught the shogaku-ichiyo(an essay on waka poems)to his pupil yusai hosokawa(yusai genshi).
saneki made yusai promise that he would never to relay the teachings to anyone,even the legal heir of the hosokawa family,and that they were only to be taught to one descendent of the sanjonishi family to prevent this knowledge left untold in the family.
this came true,when saneki's son kinkuni died at a young age,and yusai passed the teachings on to saneki's grandson saneeda.
his collection of poems include 'sankoinshu.'
