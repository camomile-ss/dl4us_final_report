imadegawa-dori street

it starts from the gate of jisho-ji(ginkaku-ji)temple(ginkakuji-cho,sakyo ward)in the east,and ends slightly west of tojiin station of the keifuku electric railroad.
the section east of the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)can be called higashi-imadegawa-dori street.
it runs along the northern edge of kyoto gyoen national garden.
the street was outside heian-kyo,but it was developed later with the expansion of the downtown area to the northeast.
its was originally called kitakoji-dori street.
the name 'imade-gawa' originates from a tributary of the kamo-gawa river called the imade-gawa river,which ran from higashi-no-toin-dori street to higashikyogoku-oji street(the present-day teramachi-dori street).
the imadegawa line of the kyoto city trams ran until 1976 from shirakawa-dori street(ginkakuji-michi stop)to nishioji-dori street(kitano-hakubaicho stop).
