prince tokiwainomiya naohito
prince tokiwainomiya naohito(date of birth and death unknown)was a member of the imperial family during the muromachi period,and was the 4th head of the tokiwainomiya family.
according to the "kennaiki" (1447),it is known that he was the son of imperial prince tokiwainomiya mitsuhito,and he had already become a priest by that time,and his 3rd son was 12 or 13 years old.
from this,it is apparent that he was around 30 years old and had at least three sons in circa 1447,but there are few historical materials other than these facts,and his achievements are unknown.
according to the "honcho koin jounroku" (the emperor's family tree,made in muromachi period),it is known that there were two sons of imperial prince tokiwanomiya mataakira who were adopted by imperial prince fushiminomiya sadafusa,like cloistered imperial prince goko(the original name: 'tsuneoki')who was adopted by imperial prince fushiminomiya sadafusa and entered kaju-ji temple.
the relation between these two sons and 'the 3rd son who was 12 or 13 years old' described in the "kennaiki" is,however,unknown.
the "kennaiki" describes him as 'monk-prince naohito,' and this suggests that he was the only one among the heads of the tokiwanomiya family who was not given the title of imperial prince.
