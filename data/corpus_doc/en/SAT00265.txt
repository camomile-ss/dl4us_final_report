origin and history
july 11,1974:
established.
the kaiki(founding patron)was nittatsu,66th head priest of the nichiren shoshu sect taiseki-ji temple.
august 21,1982:
the first head priest was excommunicated for violating nichiren shoshu sect rules with his denial of the status of the 67th head nikken as high priest but still continues to reside at shufuku-ji temple.
the temple remains a branch temple of the nichiren shoshu sect.
the current head priest(representative director)is also a nichiren shoshu sect monk(also serves as head priest of sensho-ji temple in fushimi ward,kyoto city).
the representative(director responsible)is also a nichiren shoshu sect follower(sensho-ji temple)and the buildings on the site are also owned by shufuku-ji temple.
however,a court decision regarding the preservation of the status of the first head priest which states that is he able to occupy shufuku-ji temple for as long as he lives means that no sect activities may be conducted at shufuku-ji temple unless he were to leave for any reason.
