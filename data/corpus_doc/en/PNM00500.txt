minamoto no arihito
minamoto no arihito(1103-march 23,1147)was a kuge(japanese aristocratic class or noble man)in the late heian period.
he was the second prince of imperial prince sukehito of emperor gosanjo.
his mother was a daughter of minamono no morotada.
his wife was a daughter of fujiwara no kinzane.
he was also called hanazono sadaijin.
he was called prince arihito in the imperial family.
he was adopted by emperor shirakawa and was first regarded as successor of the emperor,but he went through shinsekikoka(leaving the imperial family and becoming a subject of the emperor)in 1119,having a family name of minamoto from the emperor because emperor toba,a grandson of emperor shirakawa had a baby which was named imperial prince akihito(later,emperor sutoku).
in 1136,he was promoted to juichii(junior first rank)sadaijin(minister of the left),and called hanazono sadaijin because he acquired hanazono rikyu(hanazono imperial villa)from the emperor.
on march 13,1147,he went into religion,being called jokaku.
after a while,he passed away.
he was outstanding in poetry,kangen(music instruments)and calligraphy and also authored "shungyoku hisho" and "shugyoku hisho" in which he compiled ceremonies and ancient practices or customs.
he seemed to be interested in fashion,and it is thought that his lifestyle triggered the practice of applying cosmetics,ohaguro(tooth blackening)and hikimayu(painted eyebrows)among the kuge people.
a diary "hanazono safu ki" (diary of hanazono safu(Ôºùsadaijin))seems to be in this eighty book series.
regarding the missing parts of hanazono safu ki,his writings for march,may and june 1124 and april,may and june 1125 and for new year's day in 1128,april 1142 and april 1144 are seen in "osan burui ki" (inscription of imperial childbirth)and "entairyaku" (diary of kinkata toin),respectively.
