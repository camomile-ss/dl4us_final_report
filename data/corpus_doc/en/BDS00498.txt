the temple was reportedly founded by saicho in 805,at the imperial request of emperor kanmu.

in 1384,kokua entered this temple as a priest in order to restore it and opened a training hall for jishu sect of buddhism,but later it fell into decline.
during the edo period,its scale was reduced with the dedication of parts of its premises to building kodai-ji temple and otani sobyo graves.
in the early meiji period,it again became a temple of the tendai sect,but,because its premises were presented to the government of kyoto prefecture for the construction of maruyama-koen park,it now possesses only the main hall and saigyo-do hall,located in its exclave.
