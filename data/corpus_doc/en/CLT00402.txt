tendon

summary
tendon,as it's commonly called today,is an abbreviation for "tenpura donburi."
the most common way of making tendon is to top a bowl of rice with a variety of tenpura and pour salty-sweet sauce over it;however,there are other methods,including flavoring the tenpura instead of pouring sauce on it or just sprinkling a bit of salt over the tenpura.
the sauce is made by mixing soup stock,soy sauce,sugar and mirin,which is a sweet rice wine used for cooking.
tendon is available at tenpura specialty restaurants and soba shops.
of all the donburi varieties,tendon is considered to be the top.
it is said that tendon was first served at a restaurant called sansada(asakusa,taito ward,tokyo;founded in 1838),where a bowl of rice was topped with deep-fried diced shrimp,whitefish and vegetables with sauce poured over it.
