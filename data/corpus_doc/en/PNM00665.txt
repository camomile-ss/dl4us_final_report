uchitsune ichijo
uchitsune ichijo(august 19,1291-november 15,1325)was a court noble and waka poet in the latter half of kamakura period.
his father was uchizane ichijo,naidaijin(minister of the center),and mother was a younger sister of uchitsune's father ietsune ichijo by a different mother(i.e.,uchizane's aunt).
he celebrated his coming of age in 1301,and ranked among the court nobles in the next year.
in 1304,when his father suddenly died,he succeeded his father as the head of the ichijo family at the age of 14.
he was so talented as a waka poet that his works were recorded in chokusen wakashu(imperial anthology of japanese poetry)after "gyokuyo wakasyu" (jeweled leaves collection)as well as "bunpo onhyakushu" and "shoku genyoshu," but allegedly somewhat untalented as a statesmen.
nevertheless,he rose to juichii kanpaku(junior first rank,the chief adviser to the emperor)toshi choja(head of the fujiwara clan)in 1318,but died young at the age of 35.
he built the funda-in temple in the tofuku-ji temple as an ancestral temple of the ichijo family.
