toyokuni(a priest)
toyokuni(years of birth and death unknown)was a priest around the 6th century.
he was known as 'toyokuni hoshi.'
according to "nihonshoki" (chronicles of japan),when emperor yomei became ill in 587,he wished to become a buddhist and asked his subjects' opinions.
there were arguments for and against it,but since soga no umako was for it,toyokuni is said to have been led into dairi(imperial palace)by anahobe no miko.
