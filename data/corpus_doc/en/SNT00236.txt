summary
mishaguji belief is widely distributed in eastern japan,and it is said that mishaguji is a kami in snake form with stones and trees being its main yorishiro(object representative of a divine spirit).
the pattern of mishaguji belief varies from region to region,with mishaguji's deity being sometimes fused with the deity of local and other types of kami.
this belief is considered to have existed from the jomon period based on the fact that objects of worship for mishaguji and things which were identical to mishaguji's yorishiro were found at a number of jomon period sites located in the area where mishaguji belief has prevailed.
