the system of kanshoku is also called shokusei.
before wwii,kiyonori konakamura advanced a theory that kanshoku and shokusei were sharply distinguished from each other based on the moral sense such that the duties decided by the emperor were called 'kanshoku' and the duties decided by bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)and retainers of the emperor without permission were called 'shokusei,' which was criticized by masajiro takikawa and others after the war.
in present japan,when part-time government officials are recruited,the title of the office and treatment for the officials are notified as saiyo yotei kanshoku in most cases.
