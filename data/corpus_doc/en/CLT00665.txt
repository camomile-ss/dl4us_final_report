biography
he was born in 1792.
he studied under kengyo ichizan and became a kengyo in 1806.
his ichina(a by-name for the blind belonging to todo-za)was someichi.
he was a virtuoso of jiuta shamisen and furthermore,was sophisticated with 'kyoto-style tegotomono' (a form of japanese chamber music)which was the style of composition and form of jiuta completed by his senior associate kengyo matsuura,and composed many great songs.
his style was neat,had long instrumental parts and many of his shamisen techniques were elaborate and many of his songs were dynamic and are preferably played even now.
he is said to have been a representative composer of kyoto-style tegotomono(a form of japanese chamber music)at its best.
in about half of his works,kengyo yaezaki played the so or koto(a long japanese zither with thirteen strings)and by yaezaki's good arrangement his works became more sophisticated ones as ensembles of shamisen and koto.
there remains an anecdote which tells that these two were a good combination and good rivals as musicians.
in one of his works called "cha ondo" (tea song),he came up with the unique method to tune the strings called 'roku sagari' (six down).
this song is referred to in 'shunkin sho' by junichiro tanizaki.
also,in the work of bunraku(japanese puppet theater)called "tsubosaka reigenki(the miraclous story of tsubosaka temple)" there is one scene where the hero sawaichi plays the part of "mamanokawa" by kengyo kikuoka.
in addition,he composed the works of yagumo-goto(two-stringed zither).
the art pioneered by kikuoka was passed down to his junior fellow kengyo mitsuzaki and he developed furthermore.
he died in 1847.
