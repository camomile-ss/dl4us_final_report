dosho
dosho(1171-august 21,1248),a buddhist priest of the soto sect,lived in the early kamakura period.
his secular surname was fujiwara no takahide.
his father was fujiwara no akimori,and his mother was a daughter of minamoto no nakaie.
he was also called "kenzan dosho" or "doshoan ryuei."
dosho was born in kyoto,and after wandering around various regions,in 1223 he went to china in the sung dynasty,along with myozen and dogen.
he attained enlightenment under the guidance of nyojo.
in the winter of 1227,when dogen got a disease on his way back to japan,an incarnation of the god appeared and gave dogen a pill.
as soon as dogen took it he became well again.
according to a legend,when dosho asked the incarnation for instruction,dosho obtained the shinsen gedoku no ho(how to prepare and take the wizard mountain poison-dispelling pill that cures all illnesses).
after he returned to japan,he lived cloistered away in a thatched hut he made at kinoshita(the present-day kamigyo ward,kyoto city)in rakusai(west of the capital of kyoto).
the hut and also himself was called "dosho-an".
since then,the masters of dosho-an have inherited the medical practices.
