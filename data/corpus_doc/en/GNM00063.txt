gion
gion is one of the most popular downtown areas and entertainment spots in kyoto.
originally,the kanji character '祇' (gi)as in '祇園' (gion)was formed by combining '示' (ji)and '氏' (shi);however, '祗園' (gion)today is a misspelling(see wikt,or wiktionary: '祇').
the kanji character formed by combining 'ネ' and '氏' in jis83 character set is still widely used for shop signs and guide signs in gion.
gion developed as a monzen-machi(a town established around a prominent temple or shrine)of the yasaka-jinja shrine(called gion-sha shrine until the end of the edo period)along shijo-dori street from the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)to the yasaka-jinja shrine on shijo-dori street.
gion is one of the major hanamachi('flower town,' or geisha district also famous for apprentice geisha)in kyoto,and has a kabuki theater called minamiza.
gion today has many bars in addition to chaya(teahouses)and ryotei(traditional japanese restaurants),and thus the traditional townscape has been disappearing;the streets lined with houses with lattice doors,however,remind one of the area's past elegance and dignity.
the north of gion which stretches from shinbashi-dori street to the shira-kawa river has been selected as one of the important preservation districts for groups of historic buildings while the area in the south around hanamikoji-dori street has been designated as the historical landscape preservation and improvement district:the preservation and use of traditional townscape have been enhanced.
additionally,the intersection of shijo-dori street and higashi-oji-dori street is called the 'gion' intersection(it is often referred to as 'gion ishidan-shita').
