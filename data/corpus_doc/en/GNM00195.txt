shimogamo days
it was opened in 1923 following shochiku kamata studio in tokyo.
as soon as its opening,contemporary dramas were temporarily filmed here since kamata studio was badly damaged by the great kanto earthquake.
the film "chigo no kenpo" (swordsmanship of a young man)whose main character was performed by chojiro hayashi(the future kazuo hasegawa)became a mega hit in 1927.
those historical dramas including "yukinojo henge" (yukinojo's revenge)and "zangiku monogatari" (a story of a late-flowering chrysanthemum)which had so-called 'shimogamo color' were extremely popular in those days.
in 1950,a fire started from the warehouse of original films in the studio.
in 1952,shochiku handed over the shimogamo studio to its subsidiary kyoto eiga(current shochiku kyoto eiga)and it transferred its studio to uzumasa.
