it is widely known that when ogai mori and others published the "omokage" (vestiges,1889),an anthology of poems in translation,they used the 396th poem of the manyoshu as the source for its title.
in addition,there is an adaptation of the 594th poem of the manyoshu:the dewdrops,under the grass in the garden which is seen in the light of the setting sun,are like the tears shed while waiting for evenings(composed by fujiwara no michitsune,no.1190,love third,volume 13 of shinkokin wakashu[new collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry]).
there is another poem which consciously imitated the 608th poem of the manyoshu:love for the person who doesn't care for me is more in vain than writing numbers on flowing water(anonymous,no.522,love first,kokin wakashu[a collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry]).
