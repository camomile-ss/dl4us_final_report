asahi club
asahi club is innai parliamentary group(may 25,1898-december 7,1901)of the house of peers existing in the meiji period.
it was a parliamentary group of councilors who paid large amount of tax,which was close to shinpo-to(progressive party)(japan,1896-1898)and was consisted of 14 people including早家崇in 1898.
on february 20,1899,sanyo-kai(a group of the house of peers)(motohiro nijo,atsumaro konoe and others)which was once a dominant group dissolved because of declining power,and then,it became a group of 22 member by merging with asahi club and being joined by sukenori soga who broke from konwa-kai(a group of the house of peers)due to its internal conflict.
however,as it was still a minority power,the members formed a new group, "doyo-kai," by merging with koshi-kai(renamed from getsuyo-kai after its internal conflict)in 1901 in order to counter kenkyu-kai(the house of peers),targeting more strong solidarity.
