mother of jojin ajari(988-year of her death is not clear)was a female waka poet in the mid-heian period.

she married fujiwara no sanekata,mutsu no kami(the governor of mutsu province),and gave birth to two children,buddhist monk jojin and joson.
she lost her husband early,in around 1014-1015.
"jojin ajari no haha no shu" (a collection of waka poems by mother of jojin ajari),her personal anthology of waka poems,is famous as one that was composed of a mother's feelings when her son jojin departed for china(sung(dynasty)).
