buke sado(the tea ceremony of samurai family)
buke sado is the tea ceremony performed among the samurai families mainly in the edo period and after.
it is also called daimyo cha.
often each clan or daimyo had its own style of tea ceremony,and many of such styles were only performed in each fief.
unlike the merchant class tea ceremony in the edo period in which the iemoto(the head of a tea ceremony school)system was established,the lord of each clan was,as it were,the head of each school in buke sado.
although the practical management of the tea ceremony was assigned to a tea ceremony instructor in most cases,there were some examples where the lord himself had profound knowledge of the tea ceremony.
major schools of buke sado include enshu-ryu,sekishu-ryu,uraku-ryu,uedasoko-ryu,chinshin-ryu,fumai-ryu,ogasawarake-sado-koryu,and oie-ryu(of tea ceremony).
founded by sekishu katagiri who was the tea ceremony teacher for the the shogun family,the sekishu school particularly had a large number of sects and permeated throughout the samurai society.
many schools are said to have disappeared along with the collapse of the samurai society following haihan-chiken(abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).
