history
the railway was planned to connect kyoto and nara.
construction began from the kyoto side,and the whole line between kyoto and nara was completed in 1895.
another railway section between nara and sakurai was completed in 1898,after the 1896 merger of nara railway with hatsuse railway,which was constructing the relevant section at the time.
in 1904,a consolidation of kinki region railway companies was negotiated,and both nara railway and nanwa railway decided to merge with kansei railway company.
