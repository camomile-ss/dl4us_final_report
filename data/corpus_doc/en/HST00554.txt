funyu no ken(japan)
funyu no ken is the right of shoen(manor in medieval japan)to decline the entry of messengers(kendenshi,shunoshi,shidoshi,etc.)from the kokuga(provincial government offices)
later,it included the right to decline the wielding of policing rights by the kebiishi(officials with judicial and police powers)and kokuga,and the right to police by the shoen holder.
in general,shoen with funyu no ken in many cases also had fuyu no ken(the right of tax exemption)(japan)and these two rights are often considered as a set.
however,while handen shuju ho(the law of periodic reallocations of rice land)was functioning,the handenshi(land reallocator)would survey rice fields that had fuyu no ken and confirm that they were excluded as targets of handen and in later years,there were rice fields that had fuyu no ken,but did not have funyu no ken.
for fuyu no ken to be recognized,it was necessary to apply for each rich field,but as desaku(an act in which farmers who live in a certain shoen cultivate lands of other)became common and the shoen side wished to include this as part of the land with fuyu no ken,a conflict arose with the kokushi side,which wanted to stop this.
in addition,in odder to introduce ikkoku heikinyaku(taxes and labor uniformly imposed on shoen and provincial land in a province)as well as to decide on target lands for manor regulation acts,the kokuga began to intervene into rice fields that were recognized to have fuyu no ken.
therefore,the shoen side obtained a decree of funyu no ken and tried to eliminate any intervention from the kokuga.
in addition,because kebiishi sometimes worked to collect taxes,a movement to keep kebiishi from entering shoen also arose and this led to the elimination of their policing rights,which was the actual task of kebiishi.
the movement towards eliminating policing rights by funyu no ken was advocated and was made into a privilege even after policing rights were transferred to the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)as 'shugo funyu' (the right to keep shugo[provincial constable]from entering the property)and this continued until the shoen system was eliminated by the sengoku daimyo(japanese territorial lord in the sengoku period).
