我れ昔(むかし)より造る所のもろもろの悪業(あくごう)は
皆無始(むし)の貪瞋癡(とんじんち)に由(よ)る,
身語意(しんごい)より生ずる所なり,
一切我今(いっさいわれいま),みな懺悔(さんげ)したてまつる
translation(english)
all bad karma that i have created in the past is
due to tonjinchi,or the three kleshas poisoning the heart of man(desire,ill will and ignorance),that have been accumulated since ancient times.
it derives from three kinds of karma arising from physical action,speaking,and thinking.
now i repent all of them.
