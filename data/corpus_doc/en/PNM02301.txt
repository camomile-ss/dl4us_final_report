sukeshige ogawa
sukeshige ogawa(year of birth and death unknown)was a busho(japanese military commander),who lived during the period of azuchi-momoyama period.
he was the son of suketada ogawa.
his another name was tadaari.
his position as a government official was samanosuke(vice-minister of left division of bureau of horses).
his pseudonym used by himself kaneganean(兼々庵).
he became hideyoshi toyotomi's personal umamawashi(horse guards),and in the keicho campaign in 1598,he was on a deployment in ulsan metropolitan city(korea).
during the battle of sekigahara,he changed sides from west squad to east squad together with his father,and rendered distinguished service,however,after the war,he underwent kaieki sanction(sudden dismissal and deprivation of position,privileges and properties).
it is said that he did so because he was closely associated with mitsunari ishida.
he practiced the tea ceremony under sen no doan,and used the name kaneganean(兼々庵).
after the forfeit,he went up to kyoto and he became a successful money changer,naming himself heizaemon yorozuya,and since the kanbun era(1655-1672),he had grown up to be such a wealthy merchant that he took charge of jinya(regional government office).
afterwards,his descendents were allowed to adopt a surname ogawa,although they were belonging to the merchant class,and they expanded their business as purveyors of the daimyos(japanese territorial lords)in the western region of japan.
however,according to a theory,yorozuya was senkitsu,who was another son(of suketada).
(according to another theory,yorozuya was from the ogawa clan,the local ruling family in ogawa-go,yoshino country,yamato province),there is also a theory which argues that he was also the son of suketada,called umanosuke,and he and mitsuuji ogawa were the same person.
