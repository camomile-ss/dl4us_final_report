kasuga-taisha shrine is located in nara park,nara city,nara prefecture.
its former name is kasuga-jinja shrine.
it is classified as a shikinaisha(myojin taisha)listed in the engishiki and one of the nijuni-sha shrines,and its former shrine classification was kanpei-taisha(large-scale state shrine).
it is the grand head shrine of all kasuga-taisha shrines in japan.
it enshrines takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and futsunushi-no-kami(futsunushi-no-mikoto),guardian gods of the fujiwara clan,and amenokoyane-no-mikoto and hime-no-kami,soshin(ancestors honored as god)of the fujiwara clan.
these four deities,collectively believed to be ujigami(tutelary gods)of the fujiwara clan,are called kasuga-no-kami.
the shrine's crest is a hanging wisteria(sagari fuji).
the deer is considered a 'shinshi' (a messenger of kami,or gods),because takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is believed to have come here riding on a white deer.
history
in 710 when the national capital was transferred to heijo-kyo in nara,fujiwara no fuhito transferred kashima-no-kami(takemikazuchi-no-mikoto),the fujiwara clan's guardian god,to mt.mikasa in kasuga to be enshrined there.
the beginnings of the shrine date from when this god came to be called kasuga-no-kami.
the shrine's history says that it was founded in 768 when fujiwara no nagate united takemikazuchi-no-mikoto of kashima-jingu shrine,futsunushi-no-mikoto of katori-jingu shrine,and amenokoyan-no-mikoto and hime-no-kami enshrined in hiraoka-jinja shrine and erected four shrine buildings at the foot of mt.mikasa
however,recent excavations have suggested that rituals may have been held in this region before the jingo-keiun period(767-770).
as the fujiwara clan became prosperous,so did the shrine.
public festivals were held in the early heian period.
kasuga-matsuri festival,a reisai(regular festival)of kasuga-taisha shrine,was one of the sanchokusai(three great festivals designated by the imperial court)along with kamo-jinja shrine's aoi-matsuri festival and iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine's iwashimizu-sai festival.
the imperial rank of shoichii(senior first rank)was conferred on takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and futsunushi-no-mikoto in 850 and amenokoyane-no-mikoto in 940.
the jinmyocho(list of deities)in the engishiki(codes and procedures on national rites and prayers)contains the passage, 'our deities of kasuga-matsuri festival in the village of yamamura in soekami county,yamato province.'
it also states that the shrine is listed as a myojin-taisha shrine and that heihaku(offerings of cloth to the gods)were offered at the tsukinami and niiname festivals.
the shrine,which houses the fujiwara clan's ujigami,has a close relationship with kofuku-ji temple,which is the clan's 'ujidera' (tutelary temple).
when fujiwara no fuyutsugu had the nanen-do hall built at kofuku-ji temple in 813,kasuga-taisha shrine's takemikazuchi-no-mikoto was held to be the shinto version of fukukensaku kannon(amoghapasa),the honzon(principal image of buddha)of the temple.
with the syncretization of shinto and buddhism,kasuga-taisha shrine and kofuku-ji temple became regarded as a united body.
towards the end of the 11th century,warrior-monks from kofuku-ji temple often took part in direct 'goso' (literally,forceful protest).
one such means of 'goso' was the 'shinboku-doza' (moving of the sacred tree),in which the monks went up to kyoto under the authority of the sakaki tree(shinboku(sacred tree))into which a divine spirit of kasuga-taisha shrine was infused.
in 1871,it was renamed kasuga-jinja shrine and listed as a kanpeitaisha.
in december 1946,it was given the present name of kasuga-taisha shrine.
honden(main shrine buildings)
there are four honden built in a style known as kasuga-zukuri.
takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is enshrined in the first honden,futsunushi-no-mikoto in the second,amenokoyane-no-mikoto in the third,and hime-no-kami in the fourth.
there is no haiden(hall of worship).
general visitors,who have paid hatsuho-ryo(ceremony fee)in front of the votive offering hall to request special viewing,pray at the chumon gate.
setsumatsusha(auxiliary and branch shrines)
there are many setsumatsusha in the shrine's large precinct.
wakimiya-jinja shrine,a sessha(auxiliary shrine)that stands to the east of the honden,enshrines amenooshikumone-no-mikoto,the mikogami(child god)of hime-no-kami.
the twelve shrines,including wakamiya-jinja shrine and meoto-daikokusha shrine,that stand to the east of the honden have been revered since ancient times as the 'pilgrimage to the twelve shrines of the god of good fortune.'
the sessha enomoto-jinja shrine(listed as a minor shrine in the engishiki jinmyocho)stands at the southwestern corner of the honden's cloister.
the enshrined deity of enomoto-jinja shrine is a jinushigami(god of an area of land),a god believed to have been originally enshrined in this area.
sarutahiko is the deity presently enshrined but kosenohime myojin was enshrined there until the medieval period.
