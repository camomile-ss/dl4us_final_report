ukanomitama
ukanomitama is a deity that appears in japanese mythology(shinto religion).
kojiki(records of ancient matters)describes it as "ukanomitama no kami" and nihonshoki(chronicles of japan)as "uganomitama no mikoto."
in kojiki,the pedigree record of susanoo(deity in japanese mythology)defines it as a child who was born between susanoo and kamu-oichi-hime(the daughter of oyamatsumi)and a brother of otoshi no kami.
it does not appear in the main text of nihonshoki but arufumi(alternative variants to the main text)of section 6,kamiumi(the birth of deities)describes that it was born when izanagi(the male who invites)and izanami(the female who invites)were starving and depressed.
uka' in its name means grain and food,showing that it is a deity of harvest.
it is the shusaijin(main enshrined deities)of fushimi inari-taisha shrine in kyoto and widely worshiped as an inari-shin(oinari-san-god of harvests,wealth,fertility,etc.)
it is also known as miketsu kami.
some are confused to regard it as a fox because the fox was once called "ketsu," but it is a messenger of the deity that assumes the shape of a fox.
kojiki and nihonshoki only mention its name without describing what it did.
the books do not describe its sex,so it is not clear whether it is a god or goddess
fushimi inari-taisha shrine,which is the grand head shrine of inari-jinja shrine,regards it as a goddess.
it is also worshiped as a deity of harvest as well as a deity of agriculture or a deity of commerce and industry.
it is enshrined in inari-jinja shrines across the country such as fushimi inari-taisha shrine(kyoto city),kasama inari-jinja shrine(kasama city,ibaraki prefecture),yutoku inari-jinja shrine(saga prefecture).
