bean paste('an')
bean paste('an' or 'anko')is an ingredient in manju(buns filled with bean paste)and usually indicates azuki beans or other ingredients boiled with sweeteners or ingredients gelatinized with starch.
summary
although 'an' usually refers to azuki bean paste made from boiled azuki beans,pastes made using other types of boiled beans are now also called 'an'.
bean paste was commonly flavored with salt in the past,but as the use of sugar became more widespread among people in modern times,sugared bean paste became the norm.
furthermore,the paste on top of rice cakes also came to be called 'an',as is the liquid starch made from water added to starch and heated to form gelatin,which is used in food dressings like 'ankake'.
conversely,although western ingredients such as jams,cream(food),chocolate or peanut butter are wrapped inside cakes like 'an',these are not called 'an' but are considered something else.
in chinese cooking 'an' refers to ingredients wrapped in a cake made of flour,but the practice of using boiled azuki beans in common cakes in place of other ingredients is thought to have spread from buddhist temples,which forbade the eating of meat.
in china the type of 'an' used in cooking is called 'qi√†n' and is a separate concept.
