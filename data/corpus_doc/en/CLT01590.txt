kanko-ken(sightseeing areas)
kanko-ken(sightseeing areas)are areas(each of which is located in one prefecture or multiple prefectures in japan),being organized for tourism;they are designated by the japan tourism agency,an extra-ministerial bureau of the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism of japan,to develop sightseeing areas in order to distinguish japan as a tourism nation and promote tourists' visits and extended stays.
sightseeing areas are also in concert with the "visit japan" campaign.
summary
the conventional development of tourism addressed only by a narrow region called kanko-chi(tourist site)is said to pose limitations to the achievement of objectives,and therefore the areas called kanko-ken are arranged to promote an individual approach exerting the originality and ingenuity of the area referred to as a "wide area" in a comprehensive,integrated manner.
the aim is that the nation or government formulates the basic policy,has talks with the people involved in the area,works with relevant companies(including tourism operators)on the things necessary for preparation of the plan for the development of sightseeing area by the local government such as the municipalities or prefectures and the implementation of its development project,and promotes the development of that area.
this is based on 'act on promotion of tourists' visit and stay through development of tourism areas(act no.39 of may 23,2008),' and the ministry of land,infrastructure,transport and tourism takes the initiative from the standpoint of the government.
the area aiming toward the development and implementation of a sightseeing area applies to the ministry having jurisdiction over the business in question for such a designation.
once the area is designated,some exceptions are applied and in some cases a subsidy is also granted.
sixteen areas were designated on october 3,2008,and 14 areas on april 22,2009.
examples of support
once the plan for the development of a sightseeing area is approved,the following means of support are provided for the project:
subsidization pertaining to projects that are expected to be effective or fruitful in promoting tourists' visit and stays(up to 40%of subsidy rate)
