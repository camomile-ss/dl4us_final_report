emperor gotsuchimikado
emperor gotsuchimikado(july 3,1442-october 21,1500),the 103rd emperor,reigned in the muromachi period from august 21,1464 to october 21,1500.
his first name was fusahito.
brief personal history
he was enthroned after the abdication of emperor gohanazono,who passed the position to him.
(the enthronement date was december 27,1465.)
soon after the enthronement the onin war occurred,and temples,shrines and court nobles' palaces were burned down;subsequently,the imperial palace,which was financially fragile,collapsed.
he was forced to escape,whereupon he lived at muromachi dai(the mansion of the yoshimasa ashikaga)for ten years in order to be away from the war.
after the war,the emperor was keen to restore the traditional events of the imperial palace;however,it didn't go so well,and he died on september 28,1500
he was furious about the coup of meio and decided to abdicate the throne;however,he didn't do so after receiving advice from dainagon(chief councilor of state),chikanaga kanroji,who had long been an aide to the emperor.
because the imperial palace was nearly bankrupt at that time,it is said that the emperor was concerned over the worst situation in which money would have to be borrowed from masamoto hosokawa for an enthronement ceremony,even though he had caused the war.
after the emperor died,his body remained at the imperial palace for more than a month because there weren't enough funds for a funeral.
