it was passed down to the abe family who served the kuroda clan,the lord of the fukuoka domain in the chikuzen province,kyushu region.
the family crest of 'kokumochi' nichirin-mon marked in the body of the armor worn by nagamasa kuroda,the founder of the fukuoka domain,was later designated as the trademark of this school.
