yukihide nikaido
yukihide nikaido(1581-date of death is unknown)was sengoku busho(military commander in the warring state period in japan)from the azuchi momoyama period to the edo period.
he was a third son(or fourth son)of moriyoshi nikaido,and a younger brother of moritaka ashina and yukichika nikaido.
although he was a son of moriyoshi,the head of the nikaido family,he seems not to have succeeded his father as the head of the family.
in 1589,when the sukagawa-jo castle fell,he escaped to moriya village,and became an ascetic buddhist monk in the shogo-in temple.
when he returned to his birthplace in 1600,he built tokuzen-in temple and was called hoin sama(yukihide sozu).
