otowa-no-taki falls
otowa-no-taki falls are those that are said to have been in yamashiro province outside of the capital.
since each of them is described as音羽の滝(otowa-no-taki fall)in historical documents,much confusion exists over which waterfalls are being referred to.
yoshu-shoshi(a book describing various aspects of yamashiro province)lists the following three locations:
otowa-no-taki fall(kiyomizu-dera temple):this is identified as the present otowa-no-taki fall located in kiyomizu-dera temple placed in the middle of the western slope of mt.kiyomizu in higashiyama ward,kyoto city.
otowa-no-taki fall(in mt.otowa in shiga prefecture and kyoto prefecture):this is identified as the present otowa-no-taki fall in the yamashina-otowa-gawa river flowing through the middle part of the western slope of mt.otowa(in shiga prefecture and kyoto prefecture)located in yamashina ward,kyoto city.
otowa-no-taki fall(takano-gawa river(kyoto prefecture)):this fall was said to have existed in the otowa-gawa river flowing through the middle part of the western slope of mt.hiei in sakyo ward,kyoto city but the site has become a sand control dam.
