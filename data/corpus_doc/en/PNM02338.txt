sukekuni nose
sukekuni nose(year of birth and death unknown)is a samurai and government official(lower or middle ranked)over the end of the heian era and the early period of the kamakura era.
he is the eldest son of takayori nose.
nakasuke is his younger brother.
he is the father of nobukuni,masakuni,sukeuji kuragaki,kunimune,nobusuke,the wife of taira no nobunori and the wife of mitsukane takashina.
he called himself also nose kurodo(chamberlain).
he was from a family of the tada-genji(minamoto clan),which was ruined after jisho-juei war,but he succeeded the territory in nose-gun,settsu province,which his father had developed,served as a central government official(lower or middle ranked),such as kurodo,daigaku no suke(assistant director of the bureau of education)and bungp no kuni no kami(governor of bungo province),and reached shogoinoge(senior fifth rank,lower grade)in the kamakura period.
he is the ancestor of the nose clan,but it is unknown if he was a gokenin(an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods)of the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),and what he has done during jokyu war is also unknown.
it is believed that he had many daughters,and that his sons served as a central government official,such as tsuchimikadoin kurodo(chamberlain).
according to "sonpi bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy),one of his daughters became a wife of taira no nobunori and bore a son named nobunaka,but it can not be confirmed in a family tree of the taira clan,and it is doubtful in terms of the chronological consistency(it is described that another daughter who married with mitsukane takashina bore a son named nobunaka).
