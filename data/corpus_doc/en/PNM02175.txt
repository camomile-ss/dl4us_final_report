tojumaru miura
tojumaru miura(year of birth unknown-1584)was a japanese military commander who lived during the sengoku period(period of warring states).
his father was sadakatsu miura,who was a local lord of mimasaka province,and his mother was enyuin.
hideie ukita,who later became one of the gotairos(council of five elders)of the toyotomi government,was his younger maternal half-brother.
biography
his birth year is unknown,but it is assumed that he was born before 1565,when his father sadakatsu died.
as his father sadakatsu committed suicide due to iechika mimura,a local lord of bicchu province,he and his mother escaped to shimodoi village,tsudaka county,bizen province,and then they went to naoie ukita and stayed at his place.
later,hideie ukita,tojumaru's younger maternal half-brother,was born,and tojumaru's stepfather naoie raised tojumaru just like his biological son,together with his real biological son hideie.
in 1584,tojumaru was crushed to death in an earthquake when he went up to kyoto,and consequently,the mimasaka miura clan became extinct.
the purpose of his kyoto visit remains a mystery,and it is also unknown whether he went up to kyoto on behalf of his younger maternal half-brother hideie,or he just visited kyoto by himself.
considering the circumstances of those days,it is highly likely that he went up to kyoto because of a relationship between the ukita clan and hideyoshi toyotomi.
question about his name
it is certain that he was 20 years old or more when he died considering his age,but a record of his coming-of-age ceremony is nowhere to be found and his adult name is unknown.
