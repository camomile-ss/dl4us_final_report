kanoko shibori
kanoko shibori' is one of the methods of dyeing cloth regularly patterned with spots like the back of the fawn.
in japan,the original technique dates back to the nara period.
similar dyeing cloths are made in various regions across asia,but among them,japanese dyeing cloths are said to be the best in kinds and techniques.
there are extremely elaborate dyeing cloths such as 'so-shibori',a kind of kimono whose entire cloth are mounted with 'kanoko shibori' on which birds,flowers,and other beautiful sceneries patterns are designed.
so-shibori' is so elaborate that professionals in dyeing cloth spend about three years making it.
in the edo period, 'so-shibori' was restricted,because it was too luxurious.
today,it still remains as a synonym for expensive kimono along with 'kyo-yuzen' (dyed kimono made with another traditional method of dyeing cloth).
