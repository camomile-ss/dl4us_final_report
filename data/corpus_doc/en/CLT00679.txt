yaki-dofu
a yaki-dofu is a tofu where both sides are singed after being drained.
it is used in various dishes including sukiyaki(thin slices of beef,cooked with various vegetables in a table-top cast-iron pan),dengaku(grilled foods such as tofu,konnyaku or egg plants are fixed on skewers),boiled and seasoned dishes,and stir-fried dishes.
firmer types of tofu such as momendofu are used after further draining to cook baked dishes to avoid crumbling.
