story
when at the position of ushoben,moroie passed by the house in which his former girlfriend lived,and her family called him to drop in,so he returned his ox-drawn carriage and entered her house.
and,finding her looks unexpectedly beautiful,moroie regretted abandoning her and excused himself,but she just chanted sutras and made no reply.
while she chanted sutras,she came to a passage in vol.7 of "hoke-kyo sutra" (the lotus sutra),which says that(after one's death)one can soon go to heaven,and when she repeated the passage,she fainted.
though her families and moroie took care of her,she died before long.
grieving for her death,moroie secluded himself in a mountain village,so he was rumored to become a recluse.
but after that,he began to work at the court again,so he was called 'a returner official.'
