history
it is said that it originated from a thatched hut called ojo-in temple where genzan lived during the chogen era(1028-1037).
in 1161,after it was succeeded by jien from kansho,shoku entered into the temple and changed the jigo(literally, "temple name"),which is the title given to a buddhist temple,into the present one.
although the temple's fortune declined from the onin war,it was later restored.
it had been a dojo(place of buddhist practice or meditation)of fudan nenbutsu-a seminary for continual nenbutsu(buddhist invocation)chanting from ancient times,and it established a group and became the head temple of the seizan sect in 1951.
