kameosa
kameosa is a japanese specter that is introduced in "hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (one hundred bags in idleness),a collection of specters illustrations by sekien toriyama.
it is depicted as an earthenware pot having eyes,nose,and mouth,and according to sekien's explanatory note,it was a pot with happiness so to speak,for even if water is drawn from the pot,the water never exhausted.
there is also an interpretation that an earthenware pot had become a tsukumo-gami(gods to a variety of things)with soul as the years passed by,and have come to acquire power to manipulate water as it wished.
since no folklore on a specter named kameosa exist,it is thought to be a created specter,and there is a theory that it was created from "亀長" (kameosa),a pen name for harumachi koikawa as a painter,who was a disciple of sekien.
