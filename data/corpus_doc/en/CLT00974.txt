summary
for elderly people,the term western dishes conjures up an image of french full-course dinner,because french cuisine was introduced to japan between the meiji period and the showa period.
in many cases,the term western dishes is collectively used to refer to the cooking style brought from the european countries.
however,it sometimes includes american dishes.
dishes of those countries located on the borders of asia and europe such as greek dishes and caucasian dishes are hard to distinguish from oriental dishes of the neighboring areas-turkish dishes,for example.
curry and rice introduced from india via the uk is supposed to be a typical western dish,but it is difficult to define so.
