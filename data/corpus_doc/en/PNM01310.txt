due to this,fujiwara no yoshiko and her son imperial prince iyo were confined within kawara-dera temple before committing suicide;fujiwara no otomo,who had the title of dainagon(chief councilor of state),was exiled,chunagon(vice-councilor of state)fujiwara no takatoshi was stripped of his rank,and the southern house of the fujiwara clan perished(conspiracy of iyo imperial prince).
