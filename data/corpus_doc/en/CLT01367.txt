akome
akome is a kind of uchigi(daily wear or inner wear)worn under certain costumes.
it is formally called "akomeginu" as akome is worn between undergarment and outer garment(stuffing up or covering something is pronounced "aikomete" in old japanese.)
akome was basically worn by men in sokutai(traditional ceremonial court dress)costume but only the imperial family wore akome after the meiji period.
as an exception,girls waiting in the imperial court wore several akome in place of uchigi(ordinary kimono)for adults.
akome which went through the process of kinutauchi(hammering the cloth)or itabiki(coating the cloth)is specifically called "uchiginu."
shape
migoro(front and back of kimono excepting the "eri" [collar], "sode" [sleeves],and "okumi" [front])is double width like other kimono,and tarikubi(wrapped front with v-shaped neckline)which is as same as today's kimono.
its sleeve is called hirosode(a wide sleeve)whose wrist opening is approximately 36 centimeters long unlike that of "ho" [outer robe]which is approx.54 centimeters.
it is a hip-length uchigi with unsewen sides(except for girls' akome,)
it is tailored to awase(lined garment)using red-colored hiraginu(plain silk)or aya(twilled silk.)
akome was worn without lining cloth(which was called "hihegi")in summer and was tailored to a wadded version in winter.
during a festival,people wore akome of their favourite colors(called "someakome".)
when girls wore akome,they wore akome of the color combinations for female court attire,according to uchigi rule.
