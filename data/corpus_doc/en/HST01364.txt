the executive head was fusataro takano,and the managers were sen katayama and so on.

all of them were in the form of craft union,and their major activity was mutual aid between members.
takano himself opened a synactic shop and supported the activity.
in addition,it published the labor movement's journal "rodo sekai" (labor world),and the number of its members reached 5700 in 1899.
