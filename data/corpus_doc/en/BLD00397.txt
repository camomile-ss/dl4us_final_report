when the weather is good,one can enjoy the view of maejima wharf and ferries depart and arrive by as well as the mountains in oura peninsula over the sea,which has been a good spot to relax for many people.
also in the center of the park,there is a monument of a large anchor,which was built before world war ii to moor a beacon.
the monument weighs about four tons,and was borrowed from the maritime self-defense force and placed there by the city as the symbol of the park.
