teibi yakujo
teibi yakujo were regulations relating to the control of visitors to japan which were agreed between the yi-dynasty and the so clan in tsushima in 1547.
in the saryan wahen(coup of shinryo iwaya)which occurred in 1544,the jinshin yakujo concluded between the so clan and the yi-dynasty in 1512 was denounced;thereafter,trading(trade concurrent with a diplomacy visit)from japan was inhibited except for the king of japan envoy(the muromachi bakufu[japanese feudal government headed by a shogun]envoy)and the envoys from the ouchi clan and the shoni clan.
the teibi yakujo that was concluded when the so clan,who were economically dependent on japan-korea trade,managed to effect a breakthrough in the situation and a pseudo king of japan envoy was dispatched in 1547.
the jinshin yakujo,which was a peace treaty ending the sanpo war,forced the so clan to restrain the dispatching of trade ships so as to force the reduction of toshu saikensen(annual tribute ships to korea from the lord of tsushima,and trade ships annually dispatched from tsushima for trading and diplomatic visits)from 50 to 25,and to stop dispatching saikensen under the name of many shimuchowe(japanese people other than the residents of tsushima).
through repeated negotiations thereafter,the toshu saikensen increased in number to 30,but,they were reduced to 25 again by the teibi yakujo.
in addition to this,the teibi yakujo was greater in severity than the jinshin yakujo in that it stopped the right to trade for jutoshonin(japanese given korean government evidence to be granted special privileges in trading)and jushokunin(japanese given korean government post who has special technique such as healing art)before 1550,reduced the entry ports from both busan inlet and jepo(jinhae city,gyeongsang-namdo prefecture)to one of only busan inlet,and took those who stayed on gadokdo island or further west places as wako.
after the teibi yakujo was concluded,the so clan continued negotiations for requesting a reduction in restrictions relating to trading and diplomacy visits,and in 1557 the teishi yakujo was concluded.
