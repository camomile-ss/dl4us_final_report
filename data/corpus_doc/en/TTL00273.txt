summary
jikatasanyaku meant the three officers of a village,shoya(nanushi[a village headman]),kumigashira(toshiyori[a head of the group])and hyakushodai(a village headman)who conducted village government in accordance with instructions from the official agents.
it is generally considered that the nanushi was on behalf of the entire village government,the kumigashira was an assistant to the nanushi and the hyakushodai was an auditor,however,they actually had different roles.
the roles often differed not only from region to region but also from village to village even in the same region.
from the late edo period,there appeared some nanushi who had fallen due to tough economic changes and were not able to fulfill their duties,so elections of nanushi by votes(called irefuda in japanese)started to be held.
