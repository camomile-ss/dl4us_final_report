it is said that he and ginyu kanamori are the same person.
he was born in 1564 as a son between nagachika and his legitimate wife,ofuku no kata.
after his coming of age ceremony,he was called to serve nobutada oda as an attendant.
he belonged to the same generation as naritoshi mori and he was an expected person as seen in the fact that he was called directly by the master leaving his home.

later,nagachika prayed to buddha for the happiness of naganori in unryu-ji temple in takayama city,gifu prefecture.
there are graves for war dead next to the mausoleum for nobunaga in amida-ji temple and honno-ji temple in kyoto prefecture.
