our enemy is in the honno-ji temple
"our enemy is in the honno-ji temple" is allegedly the phrase uttered by mitsuhide akechi,busho(japanese military commander)in the warring states period,during the honnoji incident.
although mitsuhide's troops were ordered to attack the mori clan in bicchu province by his lord nobunaga oda,he suddely changed his path saying that his enemy was nobunaga himself in honnno-ji temple and headed towards honnno-ji temple in kyoto.
