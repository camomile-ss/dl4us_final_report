game archive project
game archive project,also known as gap,was inaugurated in 1998,by kyoto prefecture as a leasing body and other organizations.
the project advocates 'an establishment of video games archive for human resource development and utilization of the archive.'
its objective is to collect information on computer games and to compile a database of computer games,which is a collaborative effort among industry,government and academia.
incidentally,the project is barely related to 'game archives' by sony computer entertainment inc.,which distributes playstation software in playstation stores although their names are similar and confusing.
