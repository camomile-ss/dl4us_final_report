nijuyohai
nijuyohai refers to the 24 top disciples of the buddhist monk shinran when he propagated the buddhist faith in the kanto region,as well as the temples worshiping these disciples as founders.
existing three rolls of 'nijuyohai-cho' (a document with joint signatures of 24 disciples)nationwide introduce the details of nijuyohai.
it is believed that shinran,with the aim of propagating and handing down the original doctrine,chose direct disciples who would correctly inherit his teachings,against the background that an increasing number of people gradually run counter to the shinran's teachings and propagated wrong doctrine.
it is uncertain and controversial how and why those 24 disciples were chosen among a large number of disciples.
however,it is an undoubted fact that those 24 disciples played an important role in propagating buddhist faith in the kanto region.
while the temples worshiped as nijuyohai repeated relocations and rebuildings,with the establishment of branch temples,the number of temples with the status of nijuyohai has increased to around 180.
