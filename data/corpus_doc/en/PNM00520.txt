mitsunobu kano
mitsunobu kano(1565-july 15,1608)was a painter of the kano school during the azuchi-momoyama period.
he was the oldest son of eitoku kano.
first he served nobunaga oda and painted a wall at azuchi-jo castle with his father eitoku,and later served hideyoshi toyotomi.
after his father eitoku died in 1590,he became the leader of the kano school,and created wall paintings at the nagoya-jo castle in higo province and the house of hidetada tokugawa.
breaking away from the style of splendid and big paintings of the azuchi-momoyama period,he brought in yamato-e painting(a traditional japanese style painting of the late heian and kamakura periods dealing with japanese themes),and created compositions with natural depth and delicately defined trees and golden clouds.
there are many disciples who succeeded mitsunobu's painting style,which had a great influence on the kano school subsequently.
