fusan is the distribution of ofuda(paper charms)on which the words '南無阿弥陀仏、決定往生六十万人' are written,practiced in the ji sect,a pure land sect of buddhism.
it was started by ippen based on an oracle of the kumano gongen deity.
the ji sect greatly evolved between the kamakura period and the muromachi period because of both fusan and odori-nenbutsu.
