jodo-e(celebration of shakyamuni buddha's enlightenment)
jodo-e is a hoyo(buddhist memorial service)celebrating the jodo(completing the path to becoming a buddha by attaining enlightenment)of shakyamuni.
in japan,legend has it that shakyamuni achieved jodo in rogetsu(another name for december according to the lunar calendar),on december 8
therefore,jodo-e(celebration of shakyamuni buddha's enlightenment)is also called rohachie,on which occasion a memorial service is held.
in nanden bukkyo(buddhism that spread from india to sri lanka and southeast asian countries such as myanmar,thailand,laos,and cambodia),jodo-e is collectively celebrated as vesak festival on the full-moon day in may,along with kanbutsu-e(ceremony held to commemorate buddha's birthday)and nehan-e(memorial service for the anniversary of buddha's nirvana).
