fujiwara no iemasa
fujiwara no iemasa(1080-may 10,1115)was a kugyo(court noble)during the end of the heian period.
he was the second son of fujiwara no moromichi,kanpaku(the top adviser to the emperor).
fujiwara no tadazane,kanpaku,and fujiwara no ietaka,sakyo no daibu(the master of the eastern capital offices),were his paternal half-brothers.
he became sangi(councilor)and sachujo(middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards)at the rank of shosanmi(senior third rank).
he called himself sanjoakusaisho(literally,a bad sangi at sanjo).
in 1088,he was awarded jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade).
in 1094,he became jiju(chamberlain),and was admitted to the court in the same year.
he became sachujo(middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards)in 1098,and advanced to sangi(councilor)at jusanmi(junior third rank).
then he was further promoted to shosanmi(senior third rank)in 1113,but died young two years later,at the age of thirty-six.
it is said that,after his father died young,he was brought up by his grandfather,fujiwara no morosane.
it is described in the 138th section of "fukego" (a collection of sayings of fujiwara no tadamitsu)that it was young iemasa's role to clean morosane's feet and legs when morosane returned to his home.
it is said that he acted rudely and was unfamiliar with etiquette,and it is described in "chuyuki" (the diary written by fujiwara no munetada)(in the section for february 19,1106)that,when he was served with sake wine by an imperial envoy,he behaved seriously disregarding the etiquette and was accused of bad behavior.
his descendants called their families the muromachi family or hosshoji family,but their lines became extinct during the muromachi period.
