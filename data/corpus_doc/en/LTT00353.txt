summary
during the battle of dan no ura,taira no tokuko(kenreimonin)was rescued against her will.
to console tokuko,yoshitsune held a banquet giving a feast to his vassals and tokuko's court ladies.
after the banquet,yoshitsune was alone with tokuko and successfully began an affair with her using his charm.
the reason this story about an affair between yoshitsune and kenreimonin appeared is due to it being mentioned in 'genpei seisuiki' (the rise and decline of the minamoto and taira clans).
during the edo period,the story became well known even among the general public and a number of kyoka(comic tanka(satire))were written using the affair as a subject.
it is unknown as to whether or not the affair was historical fact,however,as there is virtually no credibility to the story.
