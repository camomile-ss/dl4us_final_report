emperor gokashiwabara
emperor gokashiwabara(november 19,1464-may 19,1526)was the 104th emperor,reigning from november 16,1500 to may 19,1526 in the muromachi and sengoku(warring states)periods,the latter being the period of civil wars between rival daimyo.
his first name was katsuhito.
brief personal history
he was enthroned in 1500,following the abdication of emperor gotsuchimikado.
however,due to the damage from the onin war,the financial situation of the imperial palace was fragile and the enthronement ceremony could not be afforded;therefore,the palace stopped some of the imperial ceremonies in order to save money for the enthronement ceremony,and finally,on march 22,1521,twenty-two years after the succession to the throne,there was a ceremony held after collecting donations from jitsunyo of hongan-ji temple and the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
after the onin war,court nobles were dispersed to different areas of the country and the financial situation of the imperial palace remained fragile;therefore,it was a difficult time for the emperor,since he didn't have much authority during this period.
the emperor worked to restore the imperial court events that had long been shelved due to financial difficulties,while on the other hand he cared for people who suffered from the fighting and disease.
the emperor became a believer in buddhism,and he wrote 'the wisdom sutras' for presentation to enryaku-ji temple and ninna-ji temple while the spread of smallpox continued in 1525.
it is said he was talented in tanka poetry,music and calligraphy.
he died on april 7,1526.
