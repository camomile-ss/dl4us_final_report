yukimi
yukimi is one of the japanese folkways since the medieval period,where people enjoy watching the snowing or the snowscape.
"yukimi fune zu," an ukiyoe landscape painted by kuniyoshi utagawa who was famous in the late edo period(the early-modern times in japan)is a representative example describing yukimi.
another example is 'koishikawa yuki no ashita' (the snowing morning in koishikawa)which is one of the paintings in the "thirty-six sceneries of mt.fuji," a master piece painted by hokusai katsushika(refer to the picture on the right).
in the present day,people often view the winter scenery from somewhere warm such as inside the house.
people also enjoy things that make them warm during yukimi such as yukimizake(sake drinking while enjoying a snow scene)or yukimiburo(bathing while enjoying a snow scene).
