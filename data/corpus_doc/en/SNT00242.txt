kinomata no kami
according to the japanese mythology,kinomata no kami(木俣神)(also read as konomata no kami)was born between okuninushi(chief god of izumo in southern honshu island,japan,and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region)and yakami hime of inaba.
yakami hime was the first wife of onamuji no kami.
when onamuji no kami took suseribime as his legal wife,however,yakami hime was so afraid of suseribime that she returned to her parental home,leaving her baby at a fork in a tree.
that is why the baby was named kinomata no kami.
another name for this kami is mii no kami(御井神).
although the gender of this kami is not known according to the "kojiki" (records of ancient matters),many shrines describe this kami as an eldest son of onamuji no kami in their biography.
kinomata no kami is generally worshipped as kami of tree,kami of water and kami of a safe birth.
