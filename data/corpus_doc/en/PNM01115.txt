takayoshi ichijo
takayoshi ichijo(1176-october 26,1198)was a kugyo(top court official)and politician during early days of the kamakura period.
his father was yoshiyasu ichijo and mother was a daughter of minamoto no yoshitomo,bomon-hime(the lawful wife of yoshiyasu ichijo).
minamoto no yoritomo was his uncle.
after he was granted peerage in 1184,he had successively held sama no kami(captain of samaryo,left division of bureau of horses),uhyoe no kami(captain of the right division of middle palace guards),kurodo no to(head chamberlain),etc.
meanwhile,he was appointed to the kyoto shugo(provincial constable)by the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)and had an offer of marriage to minamoto no yoritomo's daughter,o-hime(however,the match was refused by o-hime).
later,he married the daughter of motofusa matsudono and had a son,yoriuji ichijo.
in those days,minamoto no michichika was a key figure in the imperial court and opposed kanezane kujo and minamoto no yoritomo,who were connected to kanezane.
however,after the downfall of kanezane,he agreed with yoritomo's intention to increase the authority of kamakura bakufu and aimed to maintain the administrative power.
it is said that takayoshi's fast promotion was made because of michichika's anticipation to cooperate with yoritomo.
although he was promoted to sangi(councilor)in 1196 and became kugyo(top court official)with the investiture as jusanmi(junior third rank)the next year,he died of an illness at age 23 in the following year.
