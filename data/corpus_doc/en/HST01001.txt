kusarigama jutsu(art of japanese chain and sickle)
the term 'kusarigama jutsu' refers to a martial art in which a fighter,holding a sickle on a chain in one hand and the chain with a iron weight in the other,and swinging the weight in a circular motion,could throw the iron weight to the opponent's body or use the chain to entangle the weapon to retrieve and then kill him with the sickle.
incidentally,different schools use different type of kusarigama(a chain and sickle)in shape,length and the position of the chain attached to the neck of the handle,therefore,it is rare to find exactly the same type at an antique shop.
it is believed that kusarigama was mainly used as a weapon by farmers who were forced to fight in a battlefield,and eventually developed into a martial art form,but the details remain unknown.
meanwhile,jingama which ashigaru(a common foot soldier)used in a battlefield was quite different from kusarigama.
kusarigama jutsu is often transmitted with an art of naginata jutsu(art of japanese halberd).
