descriptions in mythology
in the story of ama no iwato(the hiding of amaterasu omikami,the sun goddess,in the heavenly rock cave),she created the mirror of yata(the eight-span mirror:one of the imperial regalia).
incidentally,the hinokuma-jingu and kunikakasu-jingu shrines(wakayama city)keep the mirrors of higata and hiboko created prior to the mirror of yata.
the mirror of higata and the mirror of hiboko are shintai(an object of worship housed in a shinto shrine in which the spirit of a deity is traditionally believed to dwell)of the hinokuma-jingu shrine and the kunikakasu-jingu shrine respectively.
upon tensonkorin(the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess),she was ordered to descend onto the earth to accompany ninigi(the grandson of the sun goddess)as one of itsutomonoo(five deities later to become ancestral deities of the five clans)along with amenokoyane,futodama,amenouzume and tamanooya.
