minamoto no nakaie(year of birth unknown-june 27,1180)was a busho(japanese military commander)of the late heian period.
he was the hachijo-in kurodo(chamberlain of hachijo-in).
he was the eldest son of minamoto no yoshikata,who had the title of tatewaki(to belt on a sword,guard of the imperial prince)and originated from kawachi-genji(minamoto clan from kawachi province).
