shinto taii
"shinto taii" is the name of shinto books written by various shintoists in the middle and modern ages.
the most notable is a summarization of the overview of yoshida shinto(yuiitsu shinto(one-and-only shinto)),which kanetomo yoshida wrote for yoshimasa ashikaga in 1486.
those by kanemi yoshida,the great-grandchild of kanetomo,and kanenao yoshida,an ancestor of kanetomo are also notable.
however,those that are said to be compiled by kanenao,are thought to be forged by kanetomo.
