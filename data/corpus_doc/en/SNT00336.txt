history
in the old days,tsukinami-no-matsuri seemed to be held monthly,however,it was determined in the "engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers)to hold tsukinami-no-matsuri on 11th day of june and december.
tsukinami-no-matsuri is held in the imperial court and ise-jingu shrine and,on the morning of 11th day,heihaku(silk as a gift)was provided from the imperial court to 304 gods worshipped in kinai area(hanhei).
later on,ise-jingu shrine only conducted hanhei and,when the muromachi period started,hanhei was abolished due to onin war,etc.,however,hanhei was revived in the meiji period.
currently,many shrines throughout japan determine a specific day of the month and conduct tsukinami-no-matsuri on that day.
