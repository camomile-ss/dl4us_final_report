he was born in 1542 as the son of nagayoshi miyoshi.
yoshioki,who had been determined to be a successor by his father when he was still young,was promoted to the rank of jushii(junior fourth rank)in chikuzen province in 1560,also appointed as otomoshu and shobanshu and permitted by the muromachi bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)of the 13th shogun yoshiteru ashikaga to use the character '義' from his name, '足利義輝' and identified himself as '義長' (yoshinaga).
his father moved to kawachi province,imoriyama castle in the same year,and he was assigned to take care of akutagawa-yama castle in settsu province.
