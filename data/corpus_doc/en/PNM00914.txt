taira no iemori
taira no iemori(1120(?)-1149)was a military commander at the end of the heian period.
iemori was the second son of taira no tadamori.
his mother was the daughter of fujiwara no munekane ike no zenni.
iemori was a younger paternal half-brother of taira no kiyomori.
taira no yorimori was iemori's younger brother.
in 1147,iemori was promoted to jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade)and assigned the position of hitachi no suke(assistant governor of hitachi province),and in 1148,he was promoted to jushiinoge(junior fourth rank,lower grade)and assigned the position of uma no kami(captain of the right division of the bureau of horses).
iemori exuded a powerful presence to threaten the position of his older half-brother taira no kiyomori but died of illness on the way to kumano while accompanying emperor toba in 1149.
it is written in "heiji monogatari" (the tale of heiji)that,since minamoto no yoritomo had a resemblance to iemori in personal appearance,ike no zenni begged for his life at the time of the heiji war.
additionally,there is folklore in one of the goto islands,uku island in nagasaki prefecture,that,to elude the hunt for remnants of the defeated heike clan after the battle of dan-no-ura,a younger brother of kiyomori by the name of taira no iemori migrated to uku island under the assumed name of jiro-iemori uku becoming the forefather of the uku clan(the goto clan).
