kinkane sanjo
kinkane sanjo(september 20,1679-1740)was kugyo(court noble)in the middle of the edo period.
he mostly served emperor higashiyama(the 112th),and was promoted to jusanmi konoefu(junior third rank,the headquarters of the inner palace guards).
his father was sadaijin(minister of the left)saneharu sanjo.
he had a younger brother,dainagon(major counselor),kinatsu sanjo.
his wife was a daughter of naidaijin(minister of the center),toyotada hirohata.
he had a son,udaijin(minister of the right)saneaki sanjo.
in 1689,he was conferred a peerage.
after that,he was quickly promoted as a legitimate son of the sanjo family,and although he took the post as jusanmi(junior third rank)and was ranked with kugyo in 1697,he was suddenly deprived of his official rank in 1700.
the reason is unknown,however,his own particular problem was considered to be the cause of this deprivation,since there was no significant incident occured in the imperial court in that year.
his brother,kinatsu inherited the sanjo family,and a saneaki,son of kinkane,succeeded to kinatsu to inherit the sanjo family.
