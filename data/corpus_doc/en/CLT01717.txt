rikyu shichitetsu
the term "rikyu shichitetsu" means the seven leading disciples of rikyu.
they were listed in "koshin gegaki",a book written by sosa koshin(hogensai)of omotesenke(the house of omotesenke),a great grandson of rikyu.
since then,persons included in the rikyu shichitetsu varied slightly depending on tea books.
the term "jittetsu" (ten leading disciples)is sometimes used by adding nagamasu oda(urakusai),doan sen(a son of rikyu)and murashige araki(dokun).
further,there are various views such as the one that asserts toshinaga maeda should be included instead of doan sen,or the one that asserts toyouji arima or nagachika kanamori should be included.
at any rate,however,these persons came to be called rikyu shichitetsu later,not from the beginning.
