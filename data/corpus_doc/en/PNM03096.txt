kenjiro ume
kenjiro ume(july 24,1860-august 26,1910)was a japanese jurist.
on august 25,1910,he was conferred the decoration of grand cordon of the order of the sacred treasure.
personal profile
he studied in france and germany,and his doctoral thesis written in french "de la transaction" (japanese title:wakairon)was highly evaluated even by locals.
he was one of the three scholars who drew up the japanese civil code,together with nobushige hozumi and masaakira tomii,and he was also a drafting member of the commercial code.
in addition,he also participated in writing the draft of the korean legal codes.
because of these significant achievements,ume is called 'the father of japanese civil code.'
he also contributed to the establishment of hosei university.
dr.ume is a real benkei(tough man)'
according to "hoso yawa" (a night talk about the legal circle)written by nobushige hozumi,kenjiro ume had a clear head and he drew up the draft of the code very quickly,and in addition,he was ready to listen to the other two members of the drafting committee,nobushige hozumi and masaakira tomii,and accepted their criticisms with open mind,even willing to change his own idea.
however,once he made out a draft as the final plan of the drafting committee,he obstinately maintained the original plan during the discussions held in the investigation committee of codes,making bold and eloquent counterarguments and persuasive explanations.
on the other hand,masaakira tomii dedicated himself to write up the text of the code after a thorough deliberation and he did not easily accept the arguments against his idea during the discussion between these three members of the drafting committee.
however,he was tolerated towards the opposite views proposed in the investigation committee of codes.
hozumi looked back on that time and commented that they showed contrasting characters,as masaakira tomii was uchibenkei(bossy at home,submissive outside),while kenjiro ume was sotobenkei(arrogant outside,timid at home),although hozumi thought that each of the two had a point.
