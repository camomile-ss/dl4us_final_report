minamoto no yorinaka
minamoto no yorinaka(?-august 24,1156)was a military commander of the kawachi-genji branch of the minamoto clan who lived at the end of the heian period.
he was the fifth son of minamoto no tameyoshi.
his mother was a daughter of minamoto no motozane.
or,she may have been a daughter of minamoto no suketo of the montoku-genji branch of the minamoto clan.
minamoto no yorikata and minamoto no tamemune were yorinaka's brothers who were born to the same mother.
his official posts were kamon no suke(assistant director of the house repair and cleaning office)and sahyoe no jo(officer of left division of middle palace guards).
his other names were goro kamon no suke and kamon goro.
in the hogen disturbance,he followed tameyoshi's lead and joined the battle taking the side of the retired emperor sutoku and fujiwara no yorinaga.
his force however was defeated and he and his father surrendered to his older brother minamoto no yoshitomo.
although yoshitomo begged for their lives,yoshitomo himself ended up having to kill yorinaka,his father,and his brothers in the funaokayama district in kita ward,kyoto city.
immediately before his death,yorinaka gave a loud laugh saying that 'yoshitomo is petty-minded and trying to survive leaving everyone else behind.he will regret greatly if something happens to him.'
