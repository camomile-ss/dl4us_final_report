koreko konoe(december 6,1760-november 6,1783)was "nyogo" (a wife or concubine of emperor)of the emperor gomomozono.

the emperor gomomozono passed away in november 1779.
since imperial princess yoshiko was the only child of the emperor gomomozono,koreko had to hastily adopt prince sachinomiya from a collateral line;prince sachinomiya who was the sixth son of imperial prince kaninnomiya sukehito ascended the throne as the emperor kokaku later.
koreko became the empress dowager in march 1781 and assumed the position to support the new emperor,which gave her both the title and power;nevertheless,shortly after that,she passed away on november 6,1783.
