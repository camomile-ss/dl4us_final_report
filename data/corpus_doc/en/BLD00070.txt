jotenkaku museum
jotenkaku museum is an art museum located in kyoto city,kyoto prefecture.
the jotenkaku museum was built at the side of reiho-den hall of shokoku-ji temple in 1984 as part of the project commemorating the 600th anniversary of the founding of shokoku-ji temple.
it stores and exhibits cultural properties(five national treasures and 136 national important cultural properties)including writings,paintings,and handicrafts owned by shokoku-ji temple,rokuon-ji temple(kinkaku-ji temple)and jisho-ji temple(ginkaku-ji temple)that are affiliated with the shokoku-ji school of the rinzai zen sect.
also,manno museum(osaka city),which closed in 2004,donated approximately 200 national treasures and important cultural properties to jotenkaku museum.
it is currently being extended and undergoing reconstruction in commemoration of the 600th anniversary of the death of yoshimitsu ashikaga,the founder of shokoku-ji temple,and all sections will be reopened on may 13,2007.
the exhibition area will be doubled in size upon completion,making it possible to permanently exhibit many items(including all fifty faces of "rokuonji oshoin shohekiga" (wall painting in osho-in room of rokuon-ji temple)by jakuchu ito)that are currently not exhibited due to lack of space.
