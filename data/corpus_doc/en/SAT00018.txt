history
there are numerous theories regarding the establishment of the shrine.
according to legend,kamowakeikazuchi-no-mikoto descended to the miaresho at the foot of mt.kamo-san during the reign of emperor jimmu.
the ancient text "yamashiro no kuni fudoki" tells that tamayorihime became pregnant after placing on her bed a vermilion-lacquered arrow that flowed down from the upper reaches of kamo-gawa river,and that when she gave birth to kamowakeikazuchi-no-mikoto,he was enshrined by the kamo territorial ruling family of anitamayorihiko's descendants.
the vermilion-lacquered arrow is said to be ho-no-ikazuchi-no-kami(the god of fire and thunder)enshrined in otokuni-jinja shrine or oyamakui-no-kami(the deity of mount hiei in shiga prefecture).
tamayorihime and her father kamotaketsunumi-no-mikoto are enshrined within shimogamo-jinja shrine.
the first mention in japan's six national histories from march 21,698(emperor mommu's reign)states that horseback archery had been banned on the day of the kamo festival and we also know that the shrine was revered by the imperial court with an approximately 2.5 acre field being donated by the emperor in 750.
after the capital was relocated to the city of heian-kyo in 794,the shrine became even more highly revered by the imperial court as a shrine for protection of the imperial palace and was granted the highest possible status,shoichii(senior first rank)in 807,with the kamo festival being held by royal order.
the jimmyocho(register of deities)of the engishiki law ranks it as a myojin taisha(a grand shrine that enshrines a high-ranked deity)and states that received offerings at each festival such as the myojin-sai festival,tsukinami-sai festival,ainame-sai festival and niname-sai festival.
for approximately 400 years from 810,after the model of saigu of ise-jingu shrine,saiin was placed and unmarried imperial princesses served as saio(priestesses)at the shrine.
the shrine was the first of the kampei taisha(great imperial shrines)under the meiji period integrated system of shrine ranks and second only to ise-jingu shrine,with it becoming a chokusaisha(shrine attended by imperial envoy)in 1883.
