isa-ha group of the sekishu-ryu school(a group of sekishu-ryu school of japanese tea ceremony)
the isa-ha group of the sekishu-ryu school is the buke-sado(the art of the tea ceremony of samurai families).
they are a branch of the sekishu-ryu school.
during the edo period,they had handed down a position at the bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)called sukiya-kumigashira(a person who is responsible for the tea room and equipment for the shogun)for generations,and they supported the ryuei-chado(the tea ceremony for the shogunate)in cooperation with the kajun-ha group of the sekishu-ryu school and the nomura-ha group of the sekishu-ryu school.
after the meiji restoration,the isa family retired from the tea ceremony after the fifth generation headman,but munenaga sodeyama(袖山宗脩,1853-1932),who was a disciple of the school,restored the family's tea ceremony,and his group has called themselves isa-ha group since then.
