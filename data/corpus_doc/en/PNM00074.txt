sadamitsu usui
sadamitsu usui(954-1021)was a busho(japanese military commander)who lived during the middle of the heian period.
his official name was taira no tadamichi.
his name is sometimes written as "貞道" or "忠道" instead of "貞光."
with respect to the place of his birth,there are two different views,one for the area near usui-toge pass and the other sagami province.
he served minamoto no yorimitsu and he is deemed as a member of yorimitsu shitenno(the four loyal retainers of yorimitsu)headed by watanabe no tsuna.
he is famous for the elimination of shuten doji of oeyama(mt.oe).
in konjaku monogatari(the tale of times now past),his name is recorded as one of three vassals of minamoto no yorimitsu.
(the name of watanabe no tsuna,who was the first person on the list of shitenno is not included in konjaku monogatari.)
in a fairy story kintaro,he was given a role to find kintaro on ashigarayama(mt.ashigara)by disguising himself as a logger and took him to minamoto no yorimitsu.
