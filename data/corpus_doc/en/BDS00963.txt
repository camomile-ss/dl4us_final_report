to be precise,it was referred to as tonan-in temple in todai-ji temple.
it is designated as a national historic site known as 'the former grounds of tonan-in temple in todai-ji temple.'
origin and history
it has been popularly said that tonan-in temple was founded by kukai of the shingon sect but,in fact,it is considered to have been established by shobo who was instrumental in erecting diego-ji temple.
shobo advocated studying both of the sanron and shingon sects at daigo-ji temple.
while daigo-ji temple subsequently adopted concurrent study of the shingon sect(tomitsu),which a school of the esoteric buddhism,and the sanron sect,which is a school of the non-esoteric buddhism,tonan-in temple regarded the sanron sect as the axis of teachings;however,the temple accepted buddhist monks who studied the shingon sect.
todai-ji temple consequently became recognized as the temple that embraces the teaching of both kegon and sanron sects.
as it produced numerous todai-ji betto(the head priest)in medieval times,tonan-in temple existed as one of the 2 major sub-temples of todai-ji temple with sonsho-in temple,which followed the teachings of the kegon sect that was considered as the fundamental sect of todai-ji temple,being the other.
however,comparing to sonsho-in temple with its substance still remaining unaccountable,tonan-in temple had an advantage as evidenced by copious amounts of historical materials related to todai-ji betto that the temple presented to the imperial court.
