summary
tanin-don is basically made using the recipe same as oyako-don.
oyako-don is made using chicken and eggs,whereas tanin-don is made using meat except for chicken(beef or pork),i.e.,using meat of a stranger for an egg;hence tanin-don is named after this recipe.
there is also tanin-udon in which the ingredients of tanin-don are placed on kake-udon(japanese wheat noodle with broth).
difference in names
mainly in the kansai region,donburimono using beef is called "tanin-don."
in areas other than the kansai region, "tanin-don" usually refers to the donburimono using pork.
in the kanto region,donburimono using beef is called "kaika-don."
the reason for this came from the thought that beef was a symbol of westernization of japan like sukiyaki,and the call "tanin(stragner)" sounded humble.
however,some restaurants served kaika-don using pork.
a possible reason for this is that kaika-don was interpreted as another name for tanin-don.
primarily,the kansai region is the birthplace of the name "tanin-don."
in this name,a spirit of the people in the kansai region appears saying "a stranger is a stranger."
donburi with beef meant "tanin-don" until gyu-don(donburimono with cooked beef on cooked rice)chains such as yoshinoya penetrated into the kansai region.
many noodle shops and restaurants still have menus without gyu-don but have with tanin-don.
restaurants in the country side often serve "tanin-don" under tha name of "oyako-don" in which pork used in stir-fried dishes is used instead of chicken to save preparing time and effort.
