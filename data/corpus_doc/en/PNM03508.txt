owari no mami
owari no mami was a figure in the asuka period of japan(year of birth and death unknown).
in old japanese orthography,his name had been written as wohari no mami,and it is considered to have been pronounced wofari no mami.
his kabane(hereditary title)was muraji.
in the jinshin war of 672,he fought supporting oama no miko(oshiama no miko or prince oama who became emperor tenmu following the victory in the war).
his last rank was shokinge(fifth rank,lower grade).
owari no mami appears not in the article about the jinshin war of "nihonshoki" (chronicle of japan)but in that about june 3,758 of "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued).
according to it,mami was raised to shokinge for the achievement in the jinshin war and died before being given a new kabane.
therefore,instead of mami,his descendants were equally given a kabane,sukune(third highest of the eight hereditary titles).
according to "nihonshoki," however,on january 15,685,fifty clans were given sukune and owari no muraji was one of them.
presumably,this owari no muraji was the owari clan of osumi province,and mami was from other owari clan.
and based on this article of "nihonshoki," mami is considered to have died before this date at the latest.
