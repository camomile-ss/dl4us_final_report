saho-hime
saho-hime is the god of spring.
in gogyo-setsu(the theory of five elements),spring is in the east,and the god of spring was called saho-hime,due to the fact that there is mt.saho to the east of heijo-kyo(the ancient capital of japan in current nara).
she is a young woman in a dress like the soft white spring haze.
it is a seasonal word for spring,and is used as a name for japanese confectionery.
she is a god of mt.tatsuta,and is paired with tatsuta-hime of fall.
she is unrelated to sao-hime(sao-bime)described in kiki(the kojiki(records of ancient matters)and the nihonshoki(chronicles of japan)).
