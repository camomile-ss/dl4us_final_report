history
according to shrine legend,okadakuni-jinja shrine began with the enshrining of ikukunitama no mikoto in september,659.

it is classified as a taisha(grand shrine)in engishiki jinmyocho(a register of shrines in japan).
belief in tenjin(heavenly deities)increased during the heian period and sugawara no michizane(tenjin)was enshrined alongside the existing deities,leading the shrine to become named tenjin-gu shrine.
the hachiman-gu was founded as aidono(building in which subordinate deities are enshrined)in november,938.
it was ranked as a gosha(village shrine)in the may 1873.
in march 1878,the shrine was nationally determined to be the okadakuni-jinja shrine listed in the engishiki jinmyocho and renamed okadakuni-jinja shrine.
