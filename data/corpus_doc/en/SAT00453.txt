history
t is unknown when this shrine was founded.
it was originally located 100m east of its present location.
in the engishiki jinmyocho(a register of shrines in japan),it is described as 'katsuragimiagata-jinja shrine,katsuraginoshimo county,yamato province',and ranked as taisha(grand shrine).
hachiozan saikoji-temple was built within the shrine precinct at one point and the shrine subsequently went into decline.
in 1601,the feudal load kuwayama made a branch shrine of morokuwa-jinja shrine(in present aisai city)for a deity in misayama(mausoleum of emperor iitoyo,unconfirmed)and then enshrined katsuragimiagata-jinja shrine together.
morokuwa-jinja shrine was his ubusunagami(guardian deity of his birthplace)and located in kaito district,owari province.
in 1864,an attempt was made to separate katsuragimiagata-jinja shrine from morokuwa-jinja shrine,and return it to where it once stood but saiko-ji temple was already standing there so it was transferred to its current site west of the temple.
in 1874,it became a sonsha(a village shrine).
