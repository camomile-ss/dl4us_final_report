kamonryo(bureau of housekeeping)
kamonryo refers to ryoge no kan(class outside of the ritsuryo system)belonging to kunaisho(ministry of the sovereign's household)under the ritsuryo system in ritsuryo japan.
according to "wamyo ruijusho" (dictionary of japanese names),this was also called kanimori no tsukasa.
history and official duties
kamonryo was in charge of setup when court functions were held,and cleaning the inside of the palace.
therefore,some of its official duties overlapped with those of tonomo-ryo(bureau of grounds)which managed and maintained facilities in the imperial court.
kamori(housekeeping)of tomo no miyatsuko(servant of the court administering a group)was attached,and was in charge of cleaning and setup.
80 persons of kushicho(general workers)who were assigned to government officials requiring a large number of persons were assigned,and conducted practical works.
in 820,kamonryo was formed by integrating kanimori no tsukasa(housekeeping office)of okurasho(ministry of the treasury)with uchi no kanimori no tsukasa(inner house keeping office)of kunaisho(ministry of the sovereign's household)both of which had the same official duties,as a part of administrative reforms.
