shukongo-shin
shukongo-shin is a buddhist goho zenjin(good deities protecting dharma)and is also referred to as kongoshu and jikongo.
the name was given because the shukongo-shin protects buddhism with a vajra in his hand.
the vajra symbolizes buddha's wisdom being a weapon that destroys bonno(earthly desires).
although his role is the same as that of kongo rikishi,while kongo rikishi takes a form of two naked bodies of misshaku and naraen,shukongo-shin is generally formed and placed as a single busho(japanese military commander).
there is an opinion that the origin is the same as that of kongo rikishi(nio).
he is called vajrapani in india,and expressed in the form of a half-naked body.
in china and japan,he is expressed as a bushin(god of war)in kacchu(armor and helmet)with funnuso(an angry expression found on buddhist images).
as surviving articles in japan,a statue(national treasure)in hokkedo(sangatsudo)of todai-ji temple is known.
because it is placed in a zushi(a cupboard-like case with double doors in which an image of(the)buddha,a sutra,or some other revered object is kept at a temple)on the north side of the hokkedo and the doors are allowed to open only once a year,it is very well-preserved.
it is a very precious statue made in the nara period,with gold foils and colors preserved extremely well on the surface.
a wooden statue in kongo-in temple(maizuru city)in kyoto was made by kaikei in the kamakura period while studying the statue in hokkedo of todai-ji temple.
