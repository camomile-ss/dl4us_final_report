history
hiyoshi taisha shrine first appeared in the book called "kojiki" (the record of ancient matters),which says 'ohoyamakuhi no kami god is also called yamasueno onushino kami who is enshrined at mt.hiei in chihatsu ahaumi province,which refers to hiyoshi taisha shrine.'
iwakura(dwelling place of a god,usually in reference to a large rock)is placed on the top of mt.ushio(mt.hachioji),and it was originally a place of worship.
there were two okumiya shrines on the side of iwakura(shrine built on the top of a mountain as a worship space),ushio shrine and sannomiya shrine,and the present east shrine was first established as satomiya shrine(shrine built in village area as a worship space)of ushio shrine in b.c.91.
satomiya shrine of sannomiya shrine is kinoshita shrine.
in 667,a year after omikyo-sento(transferring of the national capital to omi kyo),the god of omiwa shrine was transferred to hiyoshi taisha shrine for the sake of protecting otsu kyo(shiga prefecture).
since then,the west shrine was called omiya shrine as onamuchi no kami god(the god enshrined at the west shrine)have been positioned as having a higher rank than the ohoyamakuhi no kami god.
due to the capital being transferred to heian kyo(kyoto),hiyoshi taisha shrine started to have a reputation as a shrine that protected people from evil and disasters as it was located at kimon(the northeastern(unlucky)direction)of the nation's new capital.
in engishiki jinmyocho(the list of deities in engishiki,books of regulations and laws),hiyoshi taisha shrine was listed as one of nijuni-sha shrines(the 22 most important shinto shrines,as designated during the heian period),as well as myojin taisha(shinto shrines listed in the engishiki).
saicho,a buddhism monk,erected enryaku-ji temple on the mt hiei,and the hiyoshi taisha shrine,jinushigami(tutelary deity)of mt.hiei,was admired as a shrine for protection of enryaku-ji temple of tendai sect.
hiyoshi taisha shrine was called sanno gongen,named after san-no genhitsu shinkun enshrined in tendai-san kokusei-ji temple,the head temple of tendai sect in china.
enryaku-ji temple taught sanno-shinto,a type of shintoism linked to the doctrine of tendai sect religion and worshipped sanno-gongen.
in the medieval period,it was mikoshi from hiyoshi taisha shrine(portable shrine carried in festivals)which monks of mt.hiei used to carry out petitions.
branches of hiyoshi taisha shrine were established and gods were transferred to those branches while preaching tendai sect across japan.
in 1571,hiyoshi taisha shrine was destroyed in fire by an attack on mt.hiei by nobunaga oda.
present buildings were re-constructed after the azuchi-momoyama period.
after the death of nobunaga,hideyoshi toyotomi contributed to the rehabilitation of the shrine.
hideyoshi's childhood name 'hiyoshi maru' and nickname 'saru' (monkey)gave him the idea that this shrine was important to him.
buddhism lost its momentum due to the execution of the edict for the separation of shinto and buddhism in the meiji period.
in order to make the shrine as it was before,after the enshrined gods of the east shrine and west shrine were swapped,ohoyamakuhi no kami god of west shrine became the main enshrined god,and east shrine enshrining omononushi no kami god(onamuchi no kami god)was demoted to sessha(auxiliary shrine),omiwa-jinja shrine.
the buildings were completely recovered in 1926.

the major shrines include the following 21 shrines.
the old name of the shrine was used up until the edo period when both shinto and buddhism were still taught together.
