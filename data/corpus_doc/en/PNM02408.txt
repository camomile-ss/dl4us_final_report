minamoto no yoriharu
minamoto no yoriharu(year of birth and death unknown)was a busho(japanese military commander)in the late heian period.
he was the second son of yamato-genji,minamoto no yoritoshi.
his mother was a daughter of fujiwara no sadasuke(son of fujiwara no tokitaka),harima no kuni no kami(governor of harima province).
his common name was kaja uno.
he was nakatsukasanojo(secretary of ministry of central affairs).
his children included minamoto no chikahiro.
he was the founder of the uno clan.
at the time of the direct petition by sohei(priest soldier)of enryaku-ji temple in 1095 demanding exile of minamoto no yoshitsuna,he assumed the defensive at kamo-gawa river by the order of kanpaku(chief adviser to the emperor),fujiwara no moromichi,and fought off the sohei.
however,yoriharu's own soldiers shot arrows and hit the mikoshi(portable shrine)of hiyoshi-jinja shrine at that time,which ended up causing the stance of the enryaku-ji side still more hardened.
four years later in 1099,moromichi died suddenly at the age of 38.
chotei(imperial court),afraid that it was divine punishment,decided to punish yoriharu and sent him to sado province(according to another account,to tosa province).
yoriharu's downfall following those of his great-grandfather,minamoto no yorichika and his grandfather,minamoto no yorifusa ended up giving further impetus to power decline of yamato-genji.
