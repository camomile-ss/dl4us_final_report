rokkakushi shikimoku(bunkokuho by the rokkaku clan)
rokkakushi shikimoku was one of the bunkokuho(the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain)in the sengoku period.
rokkakushi shikimoku was established by the rokkaku clan in the minami omi province.
it is also known as yoshiharu shikimoku.
there were 67 articles in total.
rokkakushi shikimoku was established in 1567.
rokkakushi shikimoku was established when the rokkaku clan lost their authority despite their intention to increase their power because of the kannonji family feud which broke out in 1563.
under the diminishing authority of the rokkaku clan,rokkakushi shikimoku was established after sadahide gamo and other major vassals drafted the shikimoku(law codes in the itemized form,which were used in the medieval japan)and yoshikata rokkaku and yoshisuke rokkaku,father and son,approved it.
also,the agreement to swear the strict observance of the shikimoku was exchanged between shotei and yoshisuke,father and son,and 20 vassals.
unlike other bunkokuho,rokkakushi shikimoku restricted the authority of daimyo(japanese feudal lords).
this indicates the kokujin formation's strong sense of independence in the kinai region(the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of nara and kyoto).
also,the 67 articles of rokkakushi shikimoku mainly concerned the regulations over civil affairs.
as a rule,common laws of a local land were respected;however,rokkakushi shikimoku established the way to promote solidarity of a feudal lord.
rokkakushi shikimoku restricted an arbitrary deprivation of people under a domain by a feudal lord;at the same time,it also prohibited actions such as organized looting by village people against their feudal lord.
