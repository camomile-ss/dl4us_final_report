imperial prince arisugawa-no-miya yukihito
imperial prince arisugawa-no-miya yukihito(april 9,1656-august 20,1699)was a member of the imperial family who lived in the edo period.
he was the second son of the emperor gosai,and his mother was tomoko who was a daughter of tomotsuna seikanji.
his children were imperial prince arisugawa-no-miya tadahito,princess yukiko(empress of the emperor higashiyama;shoshumonin)and imperial prince sonto nyudo.
he was the third family head of the arisugawa-no-miya family.
he succeeded to the takamatsu-no-miya in 1667,and changed the miyago(reigning name)to arisugawa-no-miya in 1672.
there is a miyashogun(shogun from the imperial court)theory that says he was enthroned as a tokugawa shogun by tairo(chief minister)tadakiyo sakai when the 4th shogun tokugawa ietsuna died without an heir in 1680(＝>see "problem of heir of shogun," a case where a shogun died before the decision of an heir).
