fujiwara no tabino
fujiwara no tabino(year of birth and death unknown)was a daughter of fujiwara no fuhito and her mother was agata no inukai no michiyo.
she was a lawful wife of tachibana no moroe and a mother of tachibana no naramaro.
the empress komyo,an empress of the emperor shomu was her maternal half-sister and her husband,moroe was her maternal half-brother.
fujiwara no muchimaro,fujiwara no fusasaki,fujiwara no umakai,fujiwara no maro and fujiwara no miyako were her paternal half-sisters and half-brothers.
an established theory(advocated by bunei tsunoda)suggests that a court lady,fujiwara no yoshihi appearing in "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued)was tabino.
moroe's mother was michyio,so,marrying moroe resulted in a consanguineous marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister by their mother.
therefore,it is questionable whether she was atually michiyo's daughter.
