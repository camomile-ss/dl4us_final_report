senjun
senjun(1411-1476)was a renga(linked-verse)poet of the mid-muromachi period.
he was a monk of the rokkakudo(choho-ji temple)in kyoto.
he called himself ryuhon-bo and shunyo-bo.
it is said that he was the 26th head of the ikenobo school,famous for ikebana(or kado,the art of flower arrangement).
he started to make his name in his thirties with 'bunan tsuki senku' (one thousand verses on the moon in bunan)and 'bunan yuki senku' (one thousand verses on the snow in bunan),and he also participated in 'hatsuse senku' (one thousand verses at hatsuse)and 'kogamo senku' (one thousand verses for kogamo),among others.
during the onin war,with the help of myochin saito,shugodai(the acting military governor)of mino province,he made his residence at shunyo-bo in mino,and later passed away there.
in senjun's later years,sogi was his student,which led to 'mino senku' (one thousand verses at mino)and 'osa senku' (one thousand verses at osa).
the number of his poems that appeared in 'shinsen tsukubashu' (new tsukuba collection)was the third-largest among renga poets,after shinkei and sozei.
he also wrote a treatise on renga poetry, 'katahashi' (a fragment).
