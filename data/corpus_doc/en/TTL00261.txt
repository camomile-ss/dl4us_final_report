shosanmi
shosanmi(senior third rank)is one of the ranks in ikai(court ranks)and shinkai(ranks granted to shinto gods).
this rank is lower than junii(junior second rank)and higher than jusanmi(junior third rank).
this rank is also called 'ooimitsunokurai' in japan.
shosanmi
under the ritsuryo system(a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code),ranks higher than jusanmi were called 'ki' as well as hoshi no kurai(positions of stars),and were the ranks for kugyo(the top court officials).
while jusanmi was equivalent to chunagon(a vice-councilor of state),konoe no daisho(major captain of the palace guards)as well as dazai-no-sotsu(director of dazaifu[kyushu branch government]),shosanmi was the equivalent of dainagon(a chief councilor of state).
in the orders of merit,shosanmi is equivalent to the first order of merit.
later on,the conferment of a court rank and the appointment to an office were progressively made regardless of kanisoto(the bureaucratic system according to ikai[court rank]in the ritsuryo system).
since the ikai of dinagon was junii and that of konoe no daisho and konoefu(the headquarters of the inner palace guards)was the second or third rank,the ikai of chunagon was shosanmi in some cases.
after the modern ages,shosanmi was conferred on hakushaku(a count)of the peerage as his first ikai,and also army generals and full admirals rose to shosanmi.
nowadays,shosanmi is posthumously conferred on the people who were ministers of state,had an important government position,or made great academic achievements.
