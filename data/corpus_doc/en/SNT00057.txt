history
when the heian kyo was built,it was built as protection for the capital to remove calamities related to direction,and was originally called taishogun-do.
in the edo period,it was renamed taishogun-sha,and in the meiji period,it was changed to the current name.
the original enshrined deity was taishogun.
taishogun is a hoi-jin(the directional deity)of onmyodo(way of yin and yang;occult divination system based on the taoist theory of the five elements),and since it is a god ruling the fortune of directions for construction,moving,and travel,it was worshipped for a long time by the people.
under the order for the separation of buddhism and shintoism in the meiji period,the enshrined deity was changed to susanoo no mikoto.
cultural properties
wooden taishogun shinzo(sculpture of god),80 figures(important cultural property)

totaling 80 figures,they are all male shinzos,armed sculptures wearing armor,and helmets,sculptures in old ceremonial court dresses,sculptures of a child(only one),etc.
many are heavily damaged,but this is the only case in japan where so many old shinzos have been handed down in one shrine,and they are precious.
