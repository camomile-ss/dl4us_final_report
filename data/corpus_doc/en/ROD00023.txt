kujo-dori street
kujo-dori street is one of the major east-west streets in kyoto city.
it corresponds to the kujo-oji street south of heian-kyo.
it is connected to higashioji-dori street at higashiyama-bashi-higashizume of the kamo-gawa river(yodo-gawa river system)in the east,and it meets kadonooji-dori street in the west.
its course greatly differs from that in the heian period because the street now turns moderately southward from the west side of the senbon-dori street and also extends south from nishioji-dori street.
there was rajomon gate around the crossing with the present senbaon-dori street.
the rajomon gate was not repaired after being ruined by a destructive storm in 980,so today only a monument is left in its place.
the street was widened in the first year of showa.
kyoto city trams,which opened in 1939 between higashioji-dori street and nishioji-dori street,was abolished in 1978.
the section between abura-no-koji dori street and mibugawa-dori street(keihan-kokudo guchi)belongs to national route 1,and the section between mibugawa-dori street and kadonooji-dori street belongs to national route 171.
