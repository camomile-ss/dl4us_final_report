toshimoto hino
toshimoto hino(date of birth unknown,died july 4,1332)was a court noble at the end of kamakura period.
his father was tanenori hino.
brief personal history
he joined the direct imperial rule of emperor godaigo,who was enthroned in 1318,and became a kurodo(chamberlain).
he was influenced by emperor godaigo's neo-confucianism(sung-period neo-cunfucianism),and participated in the conspiracy to attack the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shougun).
he traveled across japan to recruit anti-shogunate forces;however,rokuhara tandai(an administrative and judicial agent in rokuhara,kyoto)scented his moves.
in 1324,he was arrested with suketomo hino in the shochu disturbance;however,he escaped punishment.
he returned to kyoto.
he was arrested again in the genko incident,which was the second anti-shogunate plot uncovered in 1331,and was sentenced to death in kuzuharagaoka,kamakura.
his death haiku(japanese poem)was 'i will die before autumn in kuzuharagaoka.my bitterness will remain forever'.
after the meiji restoration,the southern court(yoshino imperial court)became legitimate;people started to recognize toshimoto as a person who had rendered distinguished service in the anti-shogunate movement.
