features of the pass
the pass is travelable for vehicles.
although,it is a slap with series of steep hills and sharp curves that well maintained sections with double lane and narrow sections at 1.0-lane wide,where a vehicle cannot pass an oncoming car,continue intermittently.
particularly on the side of kibune,there is a spot where the hill is as steep as 20 degrees or more with successive sharp hairpin curves,where a large-sized vehicle cannot make a turn at the first try.
at the bottom of the hill,however,lies an area developed as a touristic district with fancy japanese-style restaurants and kawayuka terraces,where the traffic increases.
