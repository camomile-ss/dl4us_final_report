tenka san nasu(three eggplant-shaped tea caddies)
tenka san nasu refers to the following three nasu(eggplant-shaped tea caddy):tsukumo nasu(literally,nasu of gray hair),matsumoto nasu(nasu originally owned by shuho matsumoto),and fuji nasu(literally,nasu of mt.fuji).
the above three are famous for being excellent meibutsu(utensils for cha no yu,or the tea ceremony,that are of great historic and artistic values).
this nasu refers to a round chaire(tea caddy)with a slightly thin and raised mouth.
it is named as such because the general shape of it resembles nasu(an eggplant).
furthermore,it ranks the top of karamono-ire(tea caddy imported from china).
it is called tenka(emperor)and katatsuki(a square-shouldered tea caddy)is referred to as seii taishogun(literally, "the great general who subdues the barbarians," but here semantically shogun).
nasu chaire is also said to precede every other chaire because it is similar in shape to hoju(a wish-fulfilling gem shaped like a large droplet).
additionally,it is reported that no chaire other than nasu was used in the real bondate(one of the ritualized forms of making and serving tea,specifically in relation to the handling of chaire on a tea tray,in cha no yu)before rikyu.
