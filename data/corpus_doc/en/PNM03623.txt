fujiwara no yoshio
fujiwara no yoshio(date of birth and death unknown)was a bureaucrat who lived during the nara period.
he was said to be the seventh son of fujiwara no nakamaro("sonpi bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]).
however,there is another theory that he and his brother,whose name is also pronounced as 'fujiwara no yoshio' but a different set of japanese kanji(刷雄)is used for his given name,might be the same person(for details,see the article 'fujiwara no yoshio[藤原刷雄]').
