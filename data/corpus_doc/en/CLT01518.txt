mai-ogi(folding fan used in a japanese dance)
a mai-ogi is a folding fan used in japanese dances.
materials of a mai-ogi are the same as materials of a regular folding fan,and a mai-ogi consists of 10 sticks made of bones,bamboo,or wood,and folding-fan paper.
at the same time,the pivot of a mai-ogi has a lead weight so that a dancer can easily handle the fan when he or she throws it or does 'kaname-gaeshi,' a technique in which a dancer holds a fan with his or her fingers and turns it.
additionally,the outer two ribs of a mai-ogi are bound to fan paper with thread after they are stuck to each other with glue in order to improve the durability of the mai-ogi.
the face of a mai-ogi is sometimes solid-colored,and some mai-ogi have a family crest of each school on it.
while in a performance,performers use mai-ogi on which pictures coming from the performed play are painted.
some mai-ogi patterns or pictures have some meanings;for example,the design of a mai-ogi represents its owner's current achievement of dance studying at the inoue school.
mai-ogi are not always used in japanese dances,and some japanese dance programs need other types of folding fans such as chukei(ceremonial folding fans)and gunsen(fans used by ancient commanders).
