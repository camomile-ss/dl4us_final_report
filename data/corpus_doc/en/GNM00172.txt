maejima wharf(前島埠頭)
maejima wharf is located in maizuru port in maizuru city,kyoto prefecture.

summary
maizuru port was developed as the main port for the kinki region on the japan sea side,and a long-distance direct ferry route has operated since 1970 between this port and otaru port in otaru city,hokkaido prefecture.
initially,the ferry arrived at and departed from maizuru-nishi port(maizuru west port);maejima wharf was constructed in maizuru-higashi port(maizuru east port)in 1990 as a core wharf for domestic trade and to cope with increased transportation occurring in maizuru-nishi port.
at present,large ferries voyage seven times a week between maizuru port and otaru port,acting as a focal point between the kinki region and hokkaido.
the quay on the south side is provided with an earthquake-proof structure,enabling goods to be transported during emergencies.
due to the increasing size of ferries,a plan has been formulated to expand the wharf.
