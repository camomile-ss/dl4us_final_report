summary
soja in province
in ancient japan,the first task of kokushi(provincial governors)was to visit and worship at all the shrines within the province.
during the heian period,establishing a soja near the kokufu(provincial office)and worshiping at it became wide spread to save the tour of every shrine.
this is why the soja was generally located near the kokufu.
a large number of soja once disappeared in the medieval period and some revived later.
others have not revived yet or no body knows which used to be soja.
