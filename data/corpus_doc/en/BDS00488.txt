history
although the details(such as the year of its founding)aren't known,this temple is said to be one at which fujiwara no akirakeiko(some dono no kisaki),an empress of emperor montoku,prayed for a safe delivery.
it is also said that ariwara no narihira lived in seclusion in this temple,and therefore it's also called 'narihira-dera temple.'
subsequently,the temple's fortunes declined due to a fire caused by war or other factors,but it was rebuilt by sadayoshi kazanin during the kanbun era(between 1661 and 1673).
the hondo(main hall)was rebuilt in 1750,and its roof forms a horen(imperial carriage),which is rare.
