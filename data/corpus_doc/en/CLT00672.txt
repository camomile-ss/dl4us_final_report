tosazu(tosa vinegar)
tosazu is a mixture of sanbaizu(vinegar,soy sauce and sweet cooking rice wine mixed in roughly equal proportions)and soup stock made from dried bonito.
with a good flavor of soup stock as well as less vinegar and milder taste,tosazu is used for aemono(sliced fish,shellfish and/or vegetables mixed with a sauce such as miso or vinegar)with bland seafood.
due to its use of soup stock made from dried bonito,tosazu was named after tosa,a region famous for bonito.
a cup of nihaizu(vinegar and soy sauce mixed in roughly equal proportions)or sanbaizu together with 5 to 10 grams of sliced dried bonito will produce three-fourths cup of tosazu.
