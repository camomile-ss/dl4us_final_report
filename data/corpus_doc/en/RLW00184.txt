toba-kaido road,which is famous for the battle of toba-fushimi,is more than two kilometers west of this station.
however,this station was named as such because,in 1902,a new road(current jujo-dori street)connecting the vicinity of the station with toba-kaido road was constructed,making it possible to pass through to toba-kaido road,and it seems that the station was named after the fact that it was the nearest station to toba-kaido road.
