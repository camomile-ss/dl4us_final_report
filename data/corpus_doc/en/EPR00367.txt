muhon(without a court rank)
there are several views about her real mother such as the mother was koi(nyokan,a lady waiting in the court)by "teio hennenki" (the chronicle of emperors)or a kokyu(consort of the emperor)fujiwara no konshi by "honcho koinjounroku" (the emperor's family tree,made in the muromachi period),therefore there is no generally accepted view.

in 883,the next year,she entered nonomiya(field palace for imperial princesses to purify themselves),but before gunko(to go into ise shrine after the period of the purification),she resigned from ise saigu because of the emperor yozei's abdication from the throne in 884.
