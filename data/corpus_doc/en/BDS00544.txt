the jodo sanbu-kyo(the three main sutras of the jodo(pure land)sect)
the jodo sanbu-kyo is a collective name for the basic three sutras of the various jodo sects in japan.
the name originated from what honen said in "senchaku hongan nenbutsu-shu" ("senchaku-shu")(the holy writings of the jodo sect).
in the various japanese jodo sects,it refers to the following three sutras,which were translated into chinese characters:
"bussetsu muryoju-kyo" (the sutra of the buddha of immeasurable life):two volumes,translated by kosogai of the wei dynasty(three states period)(an abbreviated title: "daikyo sutra")
"bussetsu kanmuryoju-kyo" (the sutra of contemplation on the buddha of immeasurable life):one volume,translated by-kyoryoyasha of the sung dynasty(southern dynasty)(an abbreviated title: "kankyo sutra")
"bussetsu amida-kyo" (the sutra of amida buddha):one volume,translated by kumaraju of the late quin(an abbreviated title: "shokyo")
these sutras preach about amida nyorai,his 48 vows and 'gokuraku,' the buddha land(pure land).

many commentaries on the pure land philosophy that have been written in china and japan since the ancient times have mainly been compiled according to these three sutras.
