賛san' (also called '画賛gasan')is a review comment or praise written mainly by a viewer into an oriental painting and constitutes part of the original work and is considered to be a calligraphy work or literary work itself.

the ochi(punch line of a joke)of this story has many variations,not only shichifukujin,but also 'chikurin no shichi kenjin' (seven wise men in a bamboo clump), 'yoritomo-ko no shichi ki ochi' (the exile of seven samurais,yoritomo and others,on horseback), 'go-ishin no shichi kyo ochi' (the exile of seven nobles at the restoration), 'shichi-nagare wo katta' (purchased foreclosure),and so on.
continuing further,there exists another ochi, '(no phrase containing hachi[8])then basho no ku(poem,9)(a poem written by basho)' which can be linked with a phrase containing 7;so there are a total of 5x210 ochis.
