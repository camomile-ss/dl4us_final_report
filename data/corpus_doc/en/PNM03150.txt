brief personal history
he was born as the third son of eitai kano.
he used the surname of reizei without any permission of the reizei family,so he had no origin of kuge.
in 1850 he was adopted as the heir of the okada family who was kurodo tokoro no shu(officials of the court).
later,he became a valet who served hisatada kujo,a chief adviser to the emperor.
however,since his master hisatada was sabaku-ha(supporters of the shogun),tamechika was also sabaku-ha.
for this reason,his life was sought by radical sonjo party(royalists)and tamechika escaped to kokawa-dera temple in kii province.
however,he was severely chased by sonnojoi ha(supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians).
although he escaped to tanba province through sakai,he was captured and killed by gentaro dairaku and others of the choshu domain.
he died at the age of 42.
it is also said that he was killed at uchiyama eikyu-ji temple which was the jingu-ji temple(a temple associated with a shrine)of isonokami-jingu shrine in yamato province.
