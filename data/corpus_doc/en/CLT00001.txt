kyoto shogi
kyoto shogi is a kind of board game that is played between two players.
it is a very new kind of shogi,started in 1976 by katsuya tamiya.
also known as kyoto silver palace shogi,or kyoto silver palace kinkei hifu shogi.
the reason why the game has this name is because the back of the lance piece is gold;it has nothing to do with kyoto.
it is known for the unconventional rule that pieces should be turned over each turn.
there is a story that yasuharu oyama,the 15th shogi grand master,praised the game.
rules
mostly the same as shogi,but differing in the following points.
the board has five squares on each side.
there is no home territory or enemy territory.
the initial placement of pieces is as in the right figure.
there are the following five kinds of game pieces.
their movements are the same as in shogi.
gyoku-front and back are both king(gyokusho)
kyoto-front is a lance(kyosha),back is a gold "to"
ginkaku-front is a silver general(ginsho),back is a bishop(kakugyo)
kinkei-front is a gold general(kinsho),back is a knight(keima)
hifu-front is a rook(hisha),back is a pawn(fuhyo)
pieces are not promoted,instead being flipped over each time they move.
that is,they change their function each turn.
just as in shogi,captured pieces can be placed anywhere on the board,but can be placed either on the front or the back.
also,pawns and knights can be placed on the last row.
the placing of two pawns in one row,and achieving checkmate by placing a pawn,are not prohibited moves.
