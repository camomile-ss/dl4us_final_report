ohanjin
ohanjin(also pronounced as oubanshin)is deification of rago,one of kuyo(nine-planet crest),and is mainly enshrined as a stone monument on the border of settlement,in the center of a village,on the border of villages,crossing,or t-junction.
today ohanjin is deified as a guardian deity of a village as guardians for the community,but was originally a snake god called rafu in the indian myth and was feared as a god who brings disasters.
after it was introduced to japan it was syncretized with susano,a deity who caused eclipse.
it is also one of hasshojin(eight general gods)which control good and bad directions.
it is also called hakanokata as well as a god of war.
it would bring bad luck to move soil to the direction of this god while it brings good luck regarding warfare.
though as a result of syncretization it is categorized as a god,ohanjin is deeply related to buddhism,especially esoteric buddhism.
