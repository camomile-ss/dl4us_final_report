mitsutsuna rokkaku
mitsutsuna rokkaku(1401-march 10,1445)was a samurai(warrior)who lived in the northern and southern courts period and muromachi period.
he was the family head of the rokkaku clan in omi province(direct line of descent of the sasaki clan).
he was a son of mitsutaka rokkaku.
he was the father of mochitsuna rokkaku,tokitsuna rokkaku,and hisayori rokkaku.
as his wife was a daughter of yoshimitsu ashikaga,he won yoshinori ashikaga's trust and,based on the support by yoshinori,confronted hiei,but as yoshinori was assassinated in the kakitsu war,his fief was thrown into chaos due to lack of support.
as he had been working from an early stage as a close aide to the shogun,he handed over the position of the family head to his heir,mochitsuna,and,in 1445,he was overthrown together with mochitsuna by his son,tokitsuna,who was supported by an opponent and committed suicide with a sword.
