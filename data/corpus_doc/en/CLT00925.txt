shucked shellfish and beef,etc.are used as an ingredient.
originally,shigureni only meant 'shigure hamaguri,' a tsukudani of clams that is a noted product of kuwana city,mie prefecture.
however,it means the whole tsukudani cooked with ginger nowadays.
it is believed that 'shigure hamaguri' was named by shiko kagami,a haiku poet in the middle of the edo period.
followings are several theories for its etymology.

second,the best time of year for clams coincides with the times when shigure falls.
