gakumongenryu(the origin of learning)
"gakumongenryu" is a history book of the study of chinese classics written by shiso naba(rodo naba,naba is also pronounced nawa)in the middle of the edo period.
it is a one-volume book.
in 1789,shiso,who realized his days were numbered,made his pupil write at his dictation,after his death,his own younger brother mototsugu okuda(shosai okuda)found the manuscript while he was arranging the articles left by shiso,and talked with the heir of shiso,then published it in 1794.
on the whole,the book defends shushigaku(sogaku:neo-confucianism founded on the doctrines of zhu xi)and sticks to the view of history to consider shushigaku to be supreme.
he writes that confucianism had been overwhelmed by buddhism since the engi and tenryaku period and it changed into the learning of zen monks,that seika fujiwara began the serious study of shushigaku,and that later jinsai ito and his son togai ito,ansai yamazaki,toju nakae,and sorai ogyu tried to criticize shushigaku for meiri(fame and profit),insisting on different theories from shushigaku such as yomeigaku(neo-confucianism based on teaching of wang yangming)and kobunjigaku(study of ancient rhetoric school),and finally he stresses that shushigaku is the right and completed confucianism from which meiri was eliminated.
it also deals with the history of prose and poetry in china.
it was published several times through the edo period because of the demand to defend shushigaku at that time and its clear writing,after the meiji period,it was also published with movable type system by hakubunkan(a publisher).
