it was built in 343 according to the shrine's biography.
during the kanpyo ear(889 to 898)the huge rock of yin was worshiped as takuhatachijihime no mikoto,and the huge rock of yang was worshiped as amenooshihomii no mikoto while the small shrine in front of the rocks was worshiped as nigihaya no mikoto.
prayers were made for the ancestors of oyake family from the mononobe clan when they developed the yamashina area.
during the jisho era(1177-1180),the main building of the shrine was burned down by the monks of onjo-ji temple and all of the old documents were burned as well.
