daisanji(second to a governor)
daisanji was a government post next to a chief of chihokan(local officials)placed during the time of fu-han-ken sanchisei(fu-han-ken tripartite governance system)in the early meiji period.
it is equivalent to current vice-prefectural governor and karo(chief retainer)in the feudal system characteristic of the shogunate.
in 1869,it was decided that sei daisanji(formal daisanji)and gon daisanji(temporary daisanji)were placed under prefectural governors(chifuji[prefectural governor],chihanji[domain governor],chikenji[prefectural governor])by the reform of the governmental regulations after the return of lands and people to the emperor(there was no gonkan[supernumerary position]in prefectures).
sei and gon daisanji in domains must concurrently have been members of kogisho(the lower house)but after the kogisho abolished,either of them became a councilor of shugiin(whose name was changed from kogisho).
in 1871,councilors were placed in prefectures and the government post of daisanji was abolished due to the establishment of governmental regulation of prefectures accompanying haihan-chiken(abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).
