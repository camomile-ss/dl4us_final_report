kubomi-ishi(hollow stones)
kubomi-ishi(hollow stones)refers to the stone tools that have a shallow hollow almost in the center of fist-sized round gravel and elliptic gravel.
the hollow was the result of receiving a blow,or the one of rotary frictions;the former showed that the stones were used for breaking the walnut shell and manufacturing stone tools while the latter indicated that pestles for making a fire were pressed down on the stone.
beehive stones
beehive stones were the stone tools with many hollows.
unlike kubomi-ishi,board-like stones are selected as materials in many cases;because hollows mainly resulted from rotary frictions,beehive stones are seen as making fire mortars.
beehive stones are also called amadare-ishi(raindrops stones).
