subsequently,he assumed the position of head priest of tendai sect four times.
he held buddhist mass and built temples as the head priest of the tendai sect;politically,he acted as a guardian for michiie kujo(a grandson of kanezane)and expected that fujiwara no yoritsune(a son of michiie)would go to kamakura as the shogun,having the ideal of cooperation between the imperial court and the military government.
additionally,he protected honen who advocated senshu nenbutsu(single-mindedly chanting namu-amida-butsu,which means devoting oneself to amida buddha)and his disciple shinran,who were regarded as heretics at that time.
