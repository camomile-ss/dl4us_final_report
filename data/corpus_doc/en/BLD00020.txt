hosomi museum
hosomi museum is a private art museum mainly devoted to japanese antiquities,located in okazaki,sakyo ward,kyoto city.
hosomi museum was established to exhibit collections of oriental antiquities collected by the wealthy businessman,ryoichi hosomi(1901-1978:also known by the name of ryo hosomi and the pseudonym kokoan),who amassed his fortune through the trade of woollen textiles,and his eldest son,minoru hosomi(1922-2006).
in 1994,the hosomi art foundation was established,and the museum was opened in 1998.
the hosomi collection includes almost all areas of japanese art:paintings by rinpa(a school of japanese painting originated by korin ogata early in edo period),jakuchu ito and other painters of the edo period;buddhist paintings,buddha images and buddhist altar fittings from the heian period;artifacts unearthed from ancient tumuli;and it also includes around two dozen important cultural properties,plus many items certified as important art works.
it is said that ryoichi hosomi claimed that 'buddhist paintings of fujiwara period japan are the greatest in the world,' and 'because i learned about metal crafts before collecting works of art,i can tell superior from things of inferior design,' and certainly those buddhist paintings,and metal works,such as buddhist altar fittings and dokyo(bronze mirrors),within his collection are outstanding.
the museum is located next to okazaki-koen park,and the area boasts many cultural facilities,such as kyoto municipal museum of art and the national museum of modern art,kyoto.
the building,designed by tadasu oe,is in a modern style of architecture using a motif of the traditional kyoto machiya,and its internal atmosphere is very comfortable with a courtyard surrounded by buildings with two stories below and three above ground,a coffee shop,a restaurant,a tearoom,and a rooftop garden.
the koraimon gate of zeze-jo castle,which is owned by the foundation,has been moved and reconstructed at matsunohama,izumiotsu city,osaka prefecture.
