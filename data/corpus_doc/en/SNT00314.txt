moriya-shin
moriya-shin(also pronounced as moreya-shin)is an indigenous god(shinto)believed to live around the suwa region in nagano prefecture.
moriya-shin is a god(shinto)who bears a part in suwa shinko(suwa belief).
as a historical document,there is "suwa daimyojin ekotoba," in which its existence can be confirmed.
moriya-shin is sometimes equated with mishaguji.
according to traditions like "suwa daimyojin ekotoba" and so on,moriya-shin had been in ancient times a god(shinto)who had ruled suwa region.
but takeminakata no kami invaded suwa and a fight occurred.
moriya-shin confronted him,making use of kanawa(iron ring)as a weapon,but it was destroyed by a branch of wisteria held by takeminakata no kami and he was defeated.
it is said that thereafter,moriya-shin transferred the position of enshrined deity in suwa region to takeminakata no kami,and has been under his rule.
and the place of moreya-jinja shrine bearing his name(hashihara,kawagishi ward,okaya city,nagano prefecture)is thought to have been the place where was the headquarters of moriya-shin in this fight.
in the medieval and early-modern period,suwa clan regarded as a descendant of takeminakata no kami served as ohori(the highest rank of the saints in shinto)of kamisha of suwa-taisha shrine on one hand,moriya clan regarded as a descendant of moriya-shin served as jincho(head of shinto priests)which is shinto priest on the other.
