doka(literally,poetry on the way)
in contrast to tanka poetry as art,doka refers to tanka(31 syllables' poem)or waka(japanese poem)that includes buddhist teachings or that zen monks composed to make study and spiritual enlightenment easier to understand.
the following poems are given as examples.

when you make koicha(thick tea),be sure to use fairly hot water,dry the tea bowl before starting to make it,and stir the tea powder well into a paste;but it shouldn't be stirred so that the tea has bubbles or lumps.' (doka by rikyu)
