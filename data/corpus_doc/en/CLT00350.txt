desiccated foods
desiccated foods are foods that have been dried with the aim of enhancing flavor and storage qualities.
stores that specialize in desiccated foods are known as 'dried food stores' however,such stores have become scarce in recent times and in their stead,supermarkets,department stores and internet shopping retail have spread.
as part of trade between china and japan,japanese desiccated foods were a commodity brought into china(three types of desiccated foods were often used as an ingredient in chinese food:shark fin,dried abalone and,dried sea cucumber).
in china,these items were known as 'gan huo' (dried food).
