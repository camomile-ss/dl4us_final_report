koyasan shingon sect
koyasan shingon sect is one of shingon sect that was founded in the early heian period by kobo daishi(a posthumous title of the priest kukai)who visited china and studied esoteric buddhism with keika(also called eka)in qinglongsi temple(in xian city)in changan(xian city)during the tang dynasty(china).
the grand head temple is koyasan kongobu-ji temple.
it is also called koya sect or koya school.
kukai named kongobu of kongobu-ji temple after three kanji characters from 'kongobu rokaku issai yuga yugakyo.'
yukei matsunaga,a daisojo(a buddhist priest of the highest order)and a chief priest of fudaraku-in temple of koyasan,assumed the 412th head priest of kongobu-ji temple,grand head temple of koyasan shingon sect in november 15,2006.
the term of the head priest is four years.
the head priest is the highest position that also works as a chief abbot of koyasan shingon sect.
history
koyasan(koya-cho,ito-gun,wakayama prefecture)was granted as an imperial gift from emperor saga to kukai in 816.
since then,garan(buddhist cathedrals)and several halls were built in the koyasan,and the esoteric ritual and the education for disciples were performed at the sites.
women were barred from the mountain until 1872.
the temple name became kongobu-ji temple after the merger in 1869 between seigan-ji temple in koyasan founded by hideyoshi toyotomi in 1593 for the repose of the soul of his mother,omandokoro(mother of the chief adviser to the emperor),and kozan-ji temple founded by mokujiki ogo in 1590.
there used to be kozan-ji temple next to seigan-ji temple.
seigan-ji temple was initially called teihatsu-ji temple.
a kozan-ji temple was a chokugan-ji temple(temple built at the order of the emperor)where the imperial scroll of 'kozan-ji temple' was granted it as an imperial gift from emperor goyozei.
before the merger,the temple name of kongobu-ji temple was the name for the entire koyasan(mt.koya).
the name of a specific temple was not used as the title of the temple,unlike today's practice.
the current building of kongobu-ji temple was built in 1863 and is also used as dwelling for the head priest of koyasan shingon sect.
after the meiji period,in accordance with the religious policies of the government,the koyasan shingon sect became a part of the old shingon sect,which was merged with the other religious schools of the shingon sect(omuro school of the shingon sect[the grand head temple is ninna-ji temple],daikaku-ji school of the shingon sect[the head temple is daikaku-ji temple],etc.),and became the grand head temple of the old shingon sect.
afterward,it was split into schools and merged.
it became independent as koyasan shingon sect from the dai shingon sect in 1946,and was granted religious corporation status on february 18,1952.

crest of sect
gosan no kiri(literally,five three paulownia)
it was the crest of seigan-ji temple that was given by hideyoshi toyotomi.
mitsudomoe(literally,three comma-shaped figures in a circle)
it was the family crest of chinju niutsuhime-jinja shrine(commonly known as amano-jinja shrine).
creed and belief
when classifying the koyasan shingon sect according to the creed,it belongs to the old shingon sect(old-interpretation school)of old shingon schools(omuro school of shingon sect or daikaku-ji school of shingon sect etc.)which have ancient principles of koyasan that preach the theory of honjishin(dharma-body of dainichi nyorai(mahavairocana),ant it makes the base of the sect.
on the other hand,new shingon sect(new-interpretation school)was branched from the old shingon sect at the end of 13th century and founded by kakuban(kogyo daishi).
the new shingon sect has new principles that preach the doctrine based on kajishin(buddha-body within a practitioner[esoteric buddhism])and includes new shingon schools(chizan school of shingon sect,buzan school of shingon sect,etc.)branched from negoro-ji temple(grand head temple of new shingon sect)(wakayama prefecture).
three doctrines for believers of koyasan shingon sect
there are three doctrines about religious faith in koyasan shingon sect.
three doctrines for believers of koyasan shingon sect
decide the faith in this world and the next with the oath of daishi(literally a great master).
observe moral principles by embracing the teaching of shion juzen(four gratitude and ten good acts).
make the most of your life and others' by believing in the order of retribution.
the koyasan shingon sect has kobo daishi as its founder.
the mausoleum of kobo daishi in koyasan oku no in(inner temple)is the origin of the religious belief.
as the objects for worship,dainichi nyorai of both kongokai(spiritual principles)and taizokai(physical principles)are enshrined in saito(literally,western tower)and konpon daito(literally,primal tower),and there is a danjo(platform for religious practice)on which garan and halls such as miedo hall(it was a dwelling of kobo daishito and now enshrines mie(image)of kobo daishi)and fudodo hall are built,and the mausoleum of kobo daishi in okunoin,where he attained nirvana,is the sacred place.
all the things in the universe are representations of 'life' of dainichi nyorai and 'mandala' represents the 'life.'
the primal buddhist image is dainichi nyorai of the dharmakaya buddha and the primal scriptures are 'dainichi-kyo(mahavairocana sutra)' and 'kongocho-kyo(vajrasekhara sutra).'
in 1984,the koyasan shinto sect advocated the slogan 'make the most of life',aiming at realizing a spiritually rich society by spreading the revival of aspiration for buddhahood and the message of sokushin-jobutsu(to learn the equality and dignity of 'life' and realize the wisdom of dainichi nyorai in this world),and creating the living buddha lands in this world.
with the spirit of kyori shoju(the idea that all living things can receive a benefit,that is,live oneself and others together)by kobo daishi,they are working as 'gohogo nenju(recite a prayer to the amitabuddah)movement' a religious group to contribute to society.
the 'gohogo' means 'namu daishi henjo kongo(a sutra which is chanted to worship kobo daishi).'
requirements for priesthood and chief priest
1.tokudo(enter the buddhist priesthood)
2.kegyo(ascetic practices)
3.jukai(receive religious precepts)
4.kanjo(a consecration ceremony by pouring water onto the top of monk's head)
5.sobyo sanro(confine oneself in a temple to pray),receive official certificate,priesthood record
no.1 to 5 are the requirements for chief priest,and in addition,horyu sojo(inheritance of the system of teachings)is required.
there are some temples which have a vice priest other than the chief priest.
honorary chief priest
when he fulfills the requirements set by the koyasan shingon sect such as serving out as the chief priest of a temple belonging to koyasan shingon sect for 20 years,he would be admitted the title of a honorary chief priest.
koyasan shingon sect did not have the term of the chief priest,and it had a lifetime system,but when the chief priest leave his service due to old age or other reasons,he would be an apprentice in the temple where he used to serve.
the chief priest will be in the same status as other apprentices.
when the chief priest continues to live in the temple to educate a successive one after the retirement from the chief priest,even in the terms of the status,the apprentice(previous chief priest)in the temple would teach a chief priest.
therefore,the title of a honorary chief priest was established in consideration of the guarantee of status after the retirement from the chief priest.
another purpose of establishing the honorary post is to activate personnel by making it easy to replace the chief priest.
there is little difference between the chief priest and the honorary chief priest in their official authorities in the temple,although the honorary chief priest does not have eligibility to run for the chief abbot of koyasan shingon sect.
rank of priest
priests have to meet the requirements set by the koyasan shingon sect to be promoted to the higher rank of priest.
the requirements are to confine oneself in the mausoleum of oku no in in koyasan to pray,to pass the examination of the esoteric ritual conducted by the religious service department,to stay in the rank of priest for a certain period and so on.
