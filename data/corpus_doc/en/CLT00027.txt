dengaku folk dance
dengaku is a traditional japanese performance art.
it is a combination of music and dance.
it began in the middle of the heian period.
there are various theories about its origins,including that it developed from a 'ta-asobi' ritual to pray for a good harvest before planting rice or that it was introduced from overseas,but there are still many uncertainties as to its origins.
in 1096,people in kyoto became enthusiastic about dengaku and the aristocracy arranged performances for the emperor.
this is referred to as the 1096 dai-dengaku(in the 'rakuyo dengaku ki' (record of rakuyo dengaku)authored by oe no masafusa).
in the latter stage of the heian period dengaku troupes were formed under the protection of temples and shrines.
priests who specialized in dancing dengaku were called dengaku hoshi(dengaku priest).
there was also a period when dengaku was more popular than sarugaku,another japanese dance.
it is written in the 'taiheiki' (the record of the great peace)that takatoki hojo,a regent in the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),was addicted to dengaku and the shogun yoshimochi ashikaga in the muromachi bakufu liked the performances of a dancer named zoami.
the popularity of dengaku declined as yamato sarugaku(japanese dance)boomed.
local performances
by the present day,dengaku dances have become divided into bin-zasara and suri-sasara,depending on the type of percussion instrument used.
dengaku dances include dances that are prayers for a good harvest,and dances that are prayers for driving away evil.
there are dengaku dances featuring child dancers,including the oji-jinja shrine dengaku dance,shirahige-jinja shrine dengaku dance,gohoden's children's dengaku/furyu,kotaki chokurairo dance,dainichi-do dance and more.
