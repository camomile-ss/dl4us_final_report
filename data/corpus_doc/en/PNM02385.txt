shigesuke shibuya
shigesuke shibuya(year of birth and death unknown)was busho(japanese military commander)from the end of heian period to the early kamakura period.
he was the family of the chichibu clan,gozoku(local ruling family)of shibuya-so,musashi province and sagami province,and the child of shigekuni shibuya.
he was umanojo(an officer of the horse office).
his common name was goro.
on the article of may 23,1185 in "azuma kagami" (the mirror of the east),he was described as one of 24 appointments without permission who were offended by yoritomo and appointed to umanojo.
yoritomo was intensely abusive to him saying:
'his father(shigekuni)stayed in the province,but he was hovering about various locations by following the taira family and stayed in kyoto by following minamoto no yoshinaka when yoshinaka came to attack with many troops.'
when minamoto no yoshitsune entered the capital,he joined yoshitsune.'
as he was brave in many battles,he deserved to be forgiven for having been disowned by his family,but how could he have been fired if he was appointed to the position of efu(a palace guard).'
just get ready and ask a blacksmith to put a thick iron around your neck.'
also on the article of june 15,1185,it stated the decision to cancel the shigesuke's appointment,and yoritomo's anger towards shigesuke's turnabout could also be seen here.
because he received mercy by considering shigekuni's achievements and shigesuke's bravery,he was offended by yoritomo even more.
