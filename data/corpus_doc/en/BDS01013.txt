magaibutsu(buddha statues in cliffs and rocks)
the term "magaibutsu" refers to buddha statues which were carved into the natural rock face or bare rock or the rock scattered on mountains including an alcove of rock face.
while a stone buddhist image(an independent stone buddhist image)which was made of a cut stone can be moved,magaibutsu can not be moved because it was carved on natural rock face and so on.
summary
carving a buddha statue on natural rock had been widely seen in buddhist countries of asia.
ajanta cave and ellora caves in india and yungang grottoes and longmen grottoes in china are especially famous.
generally these large sites are called 'a stone cave' or 'a stone cave temple,' while comparatively smaller statues in korean peninsula and japan are called 'magaibutsu.'
but there is not necessarily a clear distinction between them.
in japan,the statues which are made of stone and possible to be moved are often called 'stone buddhist image.'
but as 'the stone buddhist image of usuki' shows,magaibutsu is often called 'a stone buddhist image' as well,so that there is not so strict distinction between 'stone buddhist image' and 'magaibutsu.'
magaibutsu in japan
it is said that the beginning of the making magaibutsu in japan goes back to the beginning of the heian period and that sanzon(triad)magaibutsu at the site of the komasaka-dera temple(ritto city,shiga prefecture)is an example in the early period.
from the early part to the latter part of the heian period,many magaibutsu had been actively produced in various places,ranging from kyusyu,kinki,kanto,hokuriku districts to tohoku district.
among them,it is said that about 80%of magaibutsu in japan are located in the oita prefecture.
