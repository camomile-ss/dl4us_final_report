wanyudo
wanyudo is a japanese specter described in konjaku gazu zoku hyakki(continued illustrations of the many demons past and present),a collection of illustrations of specters by sekien toriyama.
it has the appearance of a wheel of an ox-drawn carriage,with a man's face positioned in the center,and is said to take out the soul of the person who looks at it.
it is said that when one places a piece of paper indicating "koko-wa shobo-no sato" on the door as a talisman,wanyudo cannot go near the house;this derives from the anecdote in shuyo retsuden(a series of biographies of shuyo)of shiki(the chinese historical records),according to which so-shi,a disciple of koshi,the founder of confucianist in china,disliked shobo-no sato and did not set his foot in the place because of the name suggesting "to win against mother".
wanyudo by sekien is said to be a specter called "katawa-guruma",which looks like a wheel and is said to have appeared in kyoto's higashinotoin-dori street according to "regarding katawa-guruma in higashi-no-toin,kyoto" (from vol.1 of "a hundred stories from the provinces",which is a collection of ghost stories published in 1677);therefore,one possible interpretation is that wanyudo and katawa-gurumaare,which were depicted as different specters in "konjaku gazu zoku hyakki",are actually one and the same.
wanyudo is depicted as a male and katawa-guruma as a female in "konjaku gazu zoku hyakki."
katawa-guruma was depicted as a female following the publication of a book covering a wide range of topics entitled "shokoku rijin dan" (literally, "tales of villagers from various provinces)in 1743.
there is a theory that in 1677,the year in which "a hundred stories from the provinces" was published,katawa-guruma was separated into the two different specters of kagawa-guruma and wanyudo.
