rokujo-dori street
rokujo-dori street is one of the major east-west streets in kyoto city.
the street,located south of yobai-dori street and matoba-dori street and north of hanayacho-dori street,runs from kawaramachi-dori street in the east to horikawa-dori street in the west.
it corresponds to rokujo-oji street of heian-kyo.
shijo-dori street and shichijo-dori street,which share numerals in their names and originating from main streets of heian-kyo,serve as main arteries,whereas rokujo-dori street is a community road.
it has two lanes between kawaramachi-dori street and karasuma-dori street,but the section west of karasuma-dori street to horikawa-dori street is so narrow that it can barely accommodate a car.
from shinmachi-dori street to abura-no-koji dori street,it is a small-scale shopping street.
this is because the shopping street is a remnant of the past uonotana-dori street,as included in songs used to memorize east-west streets by heart(refer to the article "streets in kyoto city"),and just like nishikikoji-dori street,the width of the old day's street lined with shops has been passed down.
the street,which forms an extended line of rokujo-dori street beyond the parking lots of nishi hongan-ji temple,starts from omiya-dori street and is called tanbaguchi-dori street.
main facilities along the street
hitomachi-koryukan,kyoto
