situations that the poetries were made
the duties of the sakimori guards were harsh:they had to travel long distances from eastern japan to kyushu by themselves,and they had to procure their own food and arms while they were performing duties.
there was no exemption from tax for them,so they lived in extremely poor conditions.
sakimori-no-uta was written in such a harsh situation.

sakimori-no-uta is included in manyoshu.
some of the poems are in volumes 13 and 14,but the largest number of poems from sakimori-no-uta is included in volume 20.
