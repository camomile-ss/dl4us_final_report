suzuhikohime
suzuhiko-hime(literally,princess bells)is one of japanese yokai(ghosts,spirits and monsters)that was portrayed in sekien toriyama's yokai art collection book: "gazu hyakki tsurezure bukuro" (the illustrated bag of one hundred random demons;the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki,replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough,most of the yokais shown in this book are tsukumogami[a type of japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]).
it is a kind of the tsukumogami and portrayed as a female figure who has bells on the head.
according to expository writing in the "hyakki tsurezure bukuro," bells were once used in japan as ritual implements to call a divine spirit.
it also refers to amenouzume who succeeded to lure amaterasu omikami(the sun goddess)out of the ama no iwato(cave of heaven)in japanese mythology.
suzuhikohime is a yokai which may have been transmuted from the bells to call a divine spirit,or she was supposedly created based on the theme of 'summoning the deities' common to the above two examples.
