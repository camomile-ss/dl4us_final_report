players wear bugaku(court dance and music)masks representing deep blue-colored dragon heads and carry silver drumsticks.
they wear ho(outer robe or vestment)embroidered with kamon(one of yusoku-monyo,traditional design motifs)on yellow-colored silk gauze,and keberi no ryoto(sleeveless poncho with fur edging worn,on top of outer robe),a type of kantoi(simple type of clothing consisting of a large piece of cloth with a hole in the middle for the head)over the ho,and do up a silver band.
