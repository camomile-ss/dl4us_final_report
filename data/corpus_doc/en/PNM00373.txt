biography
he was in a position to always secretly support his elder brother in bakkaku(bakufu administration)and he,leading several hundreds of warriors,joined yoshimitsu when yoshimitsu took the field to to-ji temple in 1378.
he lived with his real mother,ki no yoshiko in ogawadai in mushanokoji and was successfully promoted to jusanmi(junior third rank)sangi(councilor)in 1402 and junii(junior second rank)gon-dainagon in 1403.
in the same year,he entered the priesthood having his head shaved by yoshimitsu in ogawadai and his priest name was dochi katsuyama
he died from a disease in the same year,and was cremated in toji-in temple.
reportedly,on the occasion of his funeral,it was said "everybody lamented his death as if it were their own father which had died."
he was conferred juichii(junior first rank)sadaijin and his posthumous name was yotoku-in.
fujiwara no masako was his wife and she gave birth to jien,but yoshimitsu called her while mitsuakira was still alive and made her give birth to gijo kajii.
this episode tells completely opposing ways of life of yoshimitsu,who had continuously unheard-of love affairs throughout his life,and of mitsuakira who had been always been obedient to his elder brother.
