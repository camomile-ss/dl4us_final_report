moritane chosokabe
moritane chosokabe(year of birth unknown-june 4,1615)was a busho(japanese military commander)who lived in the azuchi-momoyama period through to the early edo period.
he was a child of moritsune chosokabe.
brief personal history
from his childhood,he was nurtured by ukon daibu chosokabe who is a child of motochika chosokabe and his uncle.
in those days,ukon daibu stayed with the kato clan of higo province,and based on that relationship it is guessed that moritane also stayed with the kato clan.
on the occasion of osaka no eki(the siege of osaka)which began in 1614,his uncle was required to participate in the battle by his grandfather morichika chosokabe,so he and his uncle came to osaka-jo castle.
he fought for the toyotomi clan with his family,but they were defeated in osaka natsu no jin(summer siege of osaka)next year,and he was captured and beheaded in fushimi.
because moritane was killed,the main branch of the chosokabe clan was cut off forever.
