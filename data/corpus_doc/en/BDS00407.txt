rinzo
rinzo means a type of sutra warehouse that is built within a buddhist temple.
tenrinzo(another name for rinzo)
in the center of the warehouse,there is a bookshelf with the shape of a regular octahedron,which can be rotated,and daizokyo(sutra)is kept inside(the bookshelves are movable).
generally,people believe that once someone rotates the rinzo,it has the same value as reading all the buddhist scriptures.
it is said that the rinzo originated in the fu daishi of the southern dynasty(china),or liang(the southern dynasty),where there is sanzonzo(statue)of fu daishi and his two children(twins)in front of rinzo.
there is also the title of noh singing called 'rinzo.'
