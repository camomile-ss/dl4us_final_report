the stories are mainly based on "meng-qui" (beginner's guide)and bai juyi's "bai-shi wen ji," most of which recount well-known ancient stories.
although "kara" (Âîê)in "kara monogatari" refers to tang china,the text also includes many legends from other chinese dynasties.
written in graceful classical japanese style,the stories are strongly influenced by "the tale of genji" and waka poetry,with story details also differing considerably from their chinese originals.
no source texts have been identified for either tale 9,where chang wencheng(who authored 'youxianku' (cave where the fairies frolic))appears as the lover of empress zeitan,or tale 27,where a girl refuses to get married,flees to a mountain and sleeps with a dog;these have raised noteworthy questions in the history of japanese literature.
the complete annotated japanese translation(edited and written by yasuharu kobayashi)has been published in the kodansha gakujutsu bunko series.
