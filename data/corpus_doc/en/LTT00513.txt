contents
kakyo hyoshiki discussed how japanese poems should be through the application of rules derived from the chinese poetic tradition.
by applying the theory of poems in chinese that is a fundamentally different language to japanese and its poems,however,some "unreasonableness" was inevitable.
as a result,it should be stated that this book has value in the history of literature,but it is less valuable in terms of influence on japanese poetry of later days.
it is yet worth considering the reason why such a book was written at that time although it had "unreasonableness."
