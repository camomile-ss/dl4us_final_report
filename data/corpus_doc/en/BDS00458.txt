words of praise on the portrait of the holy priest shinran
the holy priest shinran identified himself as gutoku(a stupid man with tonsured head)and lived as an ordinary person without seeking any interest.
however,his contribution and virtue had been known through the ages and accepted willingly.
who knows the true intention of the appearance of shakyamuni buddha in this world.
it is because he handed over the sutra of dai muryoju-kyo(the sutra of immeasurable life(wo-liang-shou ching))directly to this holy priest.
