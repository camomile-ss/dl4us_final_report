in shinobi-monomi,a person conceals himself unnoticed in the mountains and fields,hides behind a bush and searches the state of the territory and the movement of the enemy.
shinobi-monomi was classified lower than the usual monomi(which is equal to the later shoko-sekko(officer patrol))and tosotsu(foot soldier)and ashigaru(common foot soldier)were assigned to perform this task.
there is a description in 'kenbunzatsuroku' on nobunaga oda making a monomi search for the enemy's state.
in 'ouu eikei gunki' (a war chronicle),masamune date used a shibami to guard against a night attack by the enemy.
a description can be seen in the article of july 26,1582 of the 'matsudaira ietada nikki' (a diary of ietada matsudaira),about ieyasu tokugawa using a kamari when he was fighting yoritada suwa of shinano province.
