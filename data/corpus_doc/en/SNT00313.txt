amatsukume no mikoto
amatsukume no mikoto is a god(shinto)who appears in japanese mythology.
he is mentioned as an ancestor worshiped as a deity of the kume clan.
in japanese mythology,he appears only in the scene of tensonkorin(the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess)in "kojiki" (the records of ancient matters).
he does not appear in "nihonshoki."
he was armed with amenooshihi no mikoto who is regarded as an ancestor worshiped as deity of otomo clan,and guided ninigi.
in the section of tensonkorin(the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess)of kojiki,amatsukume no mikoto and amenooshihi no mikoto are described as on equal footing.
but in the section of jinmu tosei(eastern expedition of the emperor jinmu)of nihonshoki,kumebe who was a descendant of amatsukume no mikoto was a subordinate of michinoomi no mikoto who was a descendant of amenooshihi no mikoto.
