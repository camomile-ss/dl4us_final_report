sen no kobei
sen no kobei was a master of the tea ceremony in the sengoku period(period of warring states).
he was a disciple of sen no rikyu.
there is a theory which says he was granted to use the surname of 'sen' from rikyu since he invented a baked confectionery using flour and sugar,which was the origin of 'senbei' (a rice cracker).
another theory says that senbei is originated from 'parched rice cake,' and so the truth is unknown.
