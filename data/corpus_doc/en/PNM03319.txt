brief personal history
in 584(the 13th year of emperor bidatsu's reign),zenshin-ni became a disciple of the priest,ebin,who came from goguryeo across the sea,and she became a nun,being named zenshin-ni.
when soga no umako enshrined in his residence a stone statue of miroku-butsu(miroku buddha)in 584,it is said that zenshin-ni performed saie(a buddhist ritual)together with her disciples ezen-ni and zenzo-ni.
on march 585(the 14th year of emperor bidatsu's reign),zenshin-ni was stripped of all her clerical garments and while naked,was punished by whipping at the station of tsubaichi market place(present-day sakurai city,nara prefecture)due to an anti-buddhist movement by mononobe no moriya.
in 588(in the first year of the emperor sushun),zenshin-ni went abroad to baekje to study precepts of buddhism,and returned on march,590.
after her return,she dwelled at sakurai-ji temple in yamato province(presumably present-day toyura,asuka village),and contributed to the thriving of buddhism by putting 11 nuns out into the world including zentoku.
