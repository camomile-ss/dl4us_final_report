however,in march 729,employees of prince nagaya,nuribeno miyatsuko kimitari and nakatomino miyakono muraji azumabito laid information against him saying that he did "sato(an evil course)".
prince nagaya was forced to kill himself.
imperial princess kibi died by hanging with her three sons.
she was buried on mt.ikoma as was prince nagaya.
if prince motoi,the crown prince suddenly died and if anything happened to emperor shomu who was sick himself at that time,the imperial princess who was the aunt of the emperor and her sons were thought to have had the possibility of succeeding the imperial throne.
some say in the context of the emperor's believing in the information without solid foundation to force prince nagaya,the leader of the government,to commit suicide was the emperor's doubts and fears about the throne.
