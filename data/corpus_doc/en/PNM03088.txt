while tsunekuni and tadamune resided in kanto region,yoshikatsu resided in the capital as well as yoshitaka and moved up in government service smoothly as the taira family had been growing its power.
those who have the family name of minamoto at the present day are not always related to the historical minamoto family,but descendants of minamoto no yoshikiyo use the family name of minamoto in contemporary meaning,and materials written in edo period also say their family name is minamoto.
descendants of yoshikiyo's older brother minamoto no yoshitaka and of minamoto no yoshikiyo still use the family name of minamoto today as well as descendants of yoshikatsu.
