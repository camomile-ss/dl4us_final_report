yoshitane soma(the second family head)
yoshitane soma(year of birth and death unknown)was a samurai who lived during the kamakura period.
he was the second head of the soma clan,a branch family of the chiba clan.
he was the son of morotsune soma.
he was the father of tanetsuna soma and a daughter(tokikane iwamatsu's wife)(there is a different opinion).
he was also called goro.
he held the office of palace guard.
yoshitane can be written as either '義胤' or '能胤' in japanese.
in 1201,he took over the head of the family because his father,morotsune,retired.
in 1204,when the incident of shigetada hatakeyama occurred,yoshitane supported yoshitoki hojo and defeated shigetada even though he had a blood relationship with shigetada(yoshitane's grandmother was shigetada's aunt).
due to this service,he was trusted to control part(takakiho)of mutsu province as jito shiki(manager and lord of a private estate).
in 1221,when the jokyu war broke out,yoshitane who joined the war with his son,tanetsuna(it is said that his grandson,tanetsugu soma,also joined),as the army of bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)played an active role in the battle of uji-gawa river and the battle of seta(no karahashi)bridge in omi province and rendered distinguished military service.
even after the war,he continued serving in the bakufu faithfully as gokenin(an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods),and was granted territories in also echigo province and yamato province.
