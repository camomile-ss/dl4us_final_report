kyoto-shugo(military governor of kyoto)
kyoto-shugo is one of the occupational categories of the kamakura bakufu.
at the beginning,tokimasa hojo was appointed to the position while he was in kyoto.
he took command of gokenin(immediate vassal of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods)in kyoto and engaged in guarding and judging activities in kyoto as well as performing a liaison function between the imperial court and the bakufu.
however,this was abolished when rokuhara tandai(an administrative and judicial agency in rokuhara,kyoto)was established after the jokyu war.
