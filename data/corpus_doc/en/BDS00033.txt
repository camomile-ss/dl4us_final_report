juni shinsho,the 12 protective deities
juni shinsho(the 12 protective deities)are tenbu,deities who reside in a heavenly realm,one of six realms in which the souls of living beings transmigrate from one to another;they are worshiped and shaped into statues in buddhism,and are good deities that guard buddhism.
they are also called juni yashataisho or juni shinmyoo and comprise 12 war gods who guard people who believe in the yakushi-nyorai and yakushi-kyo sutra.
summary
it is said that the juni shinsho guard each 12 hours of the day and night in accordance with the 12 wishes of yakushi-nyorai.
for this reason the zodiac is applied.
each protective deity heads each of 7,000 attendants,covering a total of 84,000 yasha,i.e.,a class of semi-divine being usually considered to be of a benevolent and inoffensive disposition but sometimes also classified together with malignant spirits.
above their heads are often placed signs modeled after the animals of the zodiac.
in japan the life-size statue of juni shinsho at shin-yakushi-ji temple in nara is the oldest,and it is famous for its excellence of form.
additionally,the juni shinsho have each principal image of buddha such as buddha,bosatsu and myoo.
each name and its corresponding principal image of buddha and the zodiac follows(although there are a few differences in the letters and sounds,depending on the sutras,but the following names are commonly used).
although the 12 deities' belongings and poses are not necessarily unified,it is nearly impossible to distinguish them only by characters depicted in pictures and statues.
in china the statue of juni shinsho had been produced in early times,and there is an example of wall painting in dunhuang city.
in china they have been worshiped in association with the zodiac,and many works in japan also depict animals of the zodiac above their heads.
in japan many statues such as the statue of shin-yakushi-ji temple in nara(eighth century)in the nara period have been produced.
in many cases,at the buddhist halls where yakushi-nyorai is placed as the principle image of buddha,each of six deities is placed on the left and right side of yakushi-nyorai,or in a line ahead of the buddhist altar.
there are various ways of expression;in one case they are placed around a circular buddhist altar such as the statues of shin-yakushi-ji temple,and in another case they form a halo or a foundation of the statue of yakushi-nyorai.
they are shown as war gods,the same as the statues of the shitenno(four guardian kings),and in many works each of twelve characters is distinguished by its facial expression or pose,and they vary widely as a group.
