teikan(imperial crown)style;a modern building with a japanese traditional tile roof,has extremely characteristic features.
it is also known as an architectural style with the name of "building wearing gun puku" (military uniform).
since it is practical,yet easily expresses japanese design,it has been used in manchukuo(manchuria),which was japan's allied country,as well as in japan;some buildings still exist.
however,they were built in the early showa period,and as a result,few buildings existed in korea or taiwan,which were colonized before the appearance of buildings in teikan(imperial crown)style.
in korea and taiwan,buildings in the neoclassical architectural style remaining from the period of japan's rule are prominent.
