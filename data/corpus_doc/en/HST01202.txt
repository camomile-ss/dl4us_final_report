cho(a unit of length in old japanese system of weights and measures)
cho is a unit of length(distance)or area in old japanese system of weights and measures.
unit of length
in this case,cho(町)is also written as丁in chinese characters.
in jorisei(system of land subdivision in ancient japan),6 shaku(unit of distance approximately equal to 30.3 centimeters)was 1 bu(歩;a unit of land measurement)and 60 bu made up 1 cho:however,at taiko kenchi(the land survey by hideyoshi toyotomi),1 cho became 60 ken(unit of distance,approximately 1.818 meters)with 1 ken being 6 shaku and 3 sun(a unit of distance,approximately 3.03 centimeters)but later with 1 ken equals to 6 shaku.
in 1891 after japan signed the treaty of the meter,1.2 kilometers was defined as 11 cho based on meters.
that means that 1 cho is approximately 109.09 meters,and 1 kilometer consists of approximately 9.1 cho.
unit of area
to distinguish it from cho as a unit of length,it is sometimes called 'chobu.'
a 10th of 1 cho is called tan using two different kanji or chinese characters, '反' or '段.'
in jorisei,an area of a square with sides of 1 cho was considered as 1 cho(chobu)(as 1 cho was 60 bu,the area was 3600 bu).
at taiko kenchi 1 cho was changed to 3000 bu(tsubo;a unit of land measurement;3.31 square meters).
in 1891 after japan signed the treaty of the meter,120 hectares was defined as 121 cho.
this means that 1 cho is approximately 0.9917 hectares(9917 square meters)and 1 square meter is approximately 100.83 cho.
as 1 cho is very close to 1 hectare,japan's transfer to the metric system in terms of areas went smoothly.
