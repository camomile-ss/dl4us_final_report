the yamato period
the yamato period is a period in japanese history.
in general,this term refers to a period of japanese history lasting from the 4th century to the 6th century,but it can sometimes refer to a period lasting from after the yayoi period to just before the nara period,including the asuka period(from the latter half of the 6 century to the 7 century).
in recent years,however,this term has become used less often,and the term "kofun period",which coincides with the yamato period,is now commonly used(kofun is the japanese word for ancient burial mounds).
the period is marked by a strengthening of yamato royal authority and control,the frequent construction of grand burial mounds(round burial mounds,and those square at one end and rounded at the other),and the settlement of the basis of the ancient japanese state.
in the first half of the yamato period,the otomo clan,the mononobe clan and the soga clan held real power at different times.
but through a law introduced by prince shotoku(the seventeen article constitution of the asuka period)and government organizational reform(the system of twelve courtly ranks),after the taika reform of 645 the political system shifted to an emperor-centered system.
the imperial court made efforts to introduce a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo codes by reforming the system of clans and hereditary titles,enforcing the ownership of all lands and serfs by the emperor,and introducing a uniform tax system(taxes in kind or service).
in addition,buddhism was introduced into japan from the korean peninsula in the first half of the 6th century(cf.the article on japanese buddhism)and through dispatches of missions to sui and tang dynasty china technological developments were made in many areas including agriculture,iron working,and architecture.
buddhist art was an area which displayed particular progress.
