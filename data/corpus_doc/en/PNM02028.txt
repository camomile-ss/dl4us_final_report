kikuhime yoshihiro
kikuhime yoshihiro(date of birth:unknown-date of death:december 4,1595)was a lady from a samurai family who lived from the end of the sengoku period(period of warring states)to the azuchi momoyama period.
she is the lawful wife of yoshimune otomo.
her father is akimasa yoshihiro,a senior vassal of the otomo clan,and muneyuki yoshihiro and muneshige tachibana are her nephews.
she is also called kikuko hime,or justa otomo which comes from her christian name,or justa yoshihiro which is derived from her maiden name.
she had four children with her husband yoshimune,but she is said to have been originally in poor health.
in 1587,she was converted to christianity by orders of her father-in-law,yoshishige otomo.
she was given a christian name 'justa.'
her son and two daughters were also baptized on this occasion.
while her son was given a christian name 'flucencio,' her daughters were given christian names 'sabina' and 'maxima.'
after she had reached osaka by orders of hideyoshi toyotomi in the bunroku war,she was taken as hostage in the residence of the otomo clan near osaka-jo castle.
but she was expelled from osaka in 1593 because her husband was punished by being deprived of his fief.
she was not even allowed to attend her husband to haisho(the place where a criminal is sent).
she fell into a dire situation,wandering about in bungo province,the former territory of her husband,with her three small children without a servant.
after that,she put herself under the protection of her nephew,muneshige tachibana,who became the lord of yanagawa-jo castle.
she was given a residence in zenin village,shimotsuma county,chikugo province.
but she died shortly after that due to the hardships.
her hogo(a buddhist name)is 'sonju in nissho' (尊寿院日正),and her graveyard is at sonju-ji temple(miyama city,fukuoka prefecture).
