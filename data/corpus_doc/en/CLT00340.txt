it has been passed down that niinamesai was first held in the asuka period,during the reign of emperor kogyoku.
although suspended for some time,it was revived in the genroku era(1688-1703)during the reign of emperor higashiyama.
prior to the adoption of the solar calendar in 1873,it was customarily held on the second u no hi(day of the rabbit)in november(lunar calendar).
the day of niinamesai was a national holiday during the period from 1873 to 1947.
