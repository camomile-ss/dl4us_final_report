tanenaga wada
tanenaga wada(1183-may 30,1213)was gokenin(an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the kamakura and muromachi through edo periods)of kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
he was a member of the wada family.
he was the legitimate son of yoshinaga wada,and the nephew of yoshimori wada.
he was commonly called heita.
it is told that he was a master of yumi(bow).
career
he was captured with his cousins,yoshinao wada and yoshishige wada(yoshimori's son),by reason that they took part in the conspiracy to commit the revolt of chikahira izumi.
although yoshinao and yoshishige were pardoned thanks to entreaty of yoshimori,only tanenaga was not pardoned and was exiled to iwase district,mutsu province(later iwashiro no kuni).
furthermore,tanenaga's residence which was confiscated was not given to yoshimori but taken away by yoshitoki hojo out of rule.
it is said that this incident triggered the subsequent battle of wada.
tanenaga was executed at the place of banishment after the battle of wada.
