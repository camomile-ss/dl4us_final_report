summary
gojo rakuen had establishments called ochaya(literally "teahouse" which refers to places where geisha entertain their guests)that have a structure similar to a japanese inn.
unlike machiai-jaya(tea houses,establishments that rented rooms in which visitors and geisha could amuse themselves)in hanamachi(geisha districts in kyoto),they offered adult entertainment.
gojo rakuen originated as two separate yukaku called gojo-hashishita and nanajo-shinchi located next to each other,but the two merged during the taisho period and became gojo rakuen.
