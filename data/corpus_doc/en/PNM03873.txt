taira no tamemori
taira no tamemori(year of birth unknown-june 10,1183?)was a military commander who lived during the last days of the heian period.
he was the second child of taira no yorimori.
it seems that yorimori had a son taira no toshimori,who became the suruga no kuni no kami(the governor of the suruga province).
he was appointed to kii no kuni no kami(the governor of kii province)in january 1176 and was appointed to kaga no kuni no kami(the governor of the kaga province)in september 1181.
according to "genpei seisuiki," tamemori went to the front together with his elder brother taira no yasumori to hunt down kumano area in october 1180;in 1182,he was appointed to the general in charge of the nankaido area under the plan of hunting down various provinces(the plan was not executed);he died in the battle by being struck his head by kanemitsu higuchi,the commanding officer of yoshinaka kiso,on june 10,1183,during the battle of the kurihara pass.
however,the tamemori's name appears in the historical materials published after 1183.in "gukansho" (jottings of a fool),the author wrote that tamemori served as an envoy for his father yorimori at the time of leaving the capital;therefore,his death in the battle in the kurikara pass might be a writing error.
