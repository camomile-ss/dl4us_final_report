tamemasa reizei
tamemasa reizei(1362-february 10,1417)was a kugyo(court noble)and a poet who lived in the muromachi period.
he was a son of tamehide reizei and a younger brother of tamekuni reizei(there has been a theory that tamemasa was tamekuni's son but adopted by tamehide).
his children were tameyuki rezei and mochitame reizei.
in 1399,he was appointed to jusani(junior third rank).
in 1401,he was appointed to sangi(royal advisor),and in the following year,he was appointed chunagon(vice-councilor of state).
in 1415,he was appointed to shonii(senior second rank)dainagon(chief councilor of state)but resigned in the following year.
in his poet career,his poems were published in "the shin-goshui wakashu" (new later collection of gleanings[of japanese poems]).
note that,from the generation of the children of tamemasa,the reizei family split into the family line of tameyuki(the kami-reizei family)and the family line of mochitame(the shimo-reizei family),but the official branch was the kami-reizei family.
