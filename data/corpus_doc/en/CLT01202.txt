omoteginu
omoteginu is one of many kimonos forming juni-hitoe(twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).
it is put on in the following order:first,one hitoe(a single layer of a kimono)is put on;next,five uchigi(ordinary kimono)are put on;next,one uchiginu(a beaten scarlet silk robe worn as a stiffener and support for the outer robes)is put on;and finally,one omoteginu is put on.
the shape of the omoteginu is no different to that of the hitoe or uchigi;however,since it is the outermost kimono that covers the other kimonos of the juni-hitoe,it is usually made of luxurious materials such as futabe-orimono(silk double weave).
