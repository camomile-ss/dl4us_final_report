ichijo-dori street
ichijo-dori street is one of the major east-west streets in kyoto city.
it corresponds to ichijo-oji street of heian-kyo.
its eastern end is karasuma-dori street.
in the west,it ends around hanazono in ukyo ward,but some refer to the street,which extends west to seiryo-ji temple(saga-shakado)in sagano,as ichijo-dori street.
it also branches at utano and leads to shuzan-kaido road.
though ichijo-oji street formed the northern edge of heian-kyo,the downtown area expanded across it northward after the mid-heian period.
imadegawa-dori street now acts as the northern boundary of kyoto gosho(old imperial palace),which runs along its north side.
ichijo-dori street,in central kyoto city,is a narrow one-way road.
ichijomodori-bashi bridge,which spans the hori-kawa river(kyoto prefecture),is well known.

the east of higashi-ichijo street is the approach to yoshida-jinja shrine,along which there are many street stalls with a lively atmosphere during the setsubun festival,the bean-throwing festival to celebrate the coming of spring.
