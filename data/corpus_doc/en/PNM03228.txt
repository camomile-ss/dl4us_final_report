jicchu
jicchu(726-year of death unknown)was a buddhist priest who lived in the nara period.
he became a pupil of roben and studied kegon(huayan[flower garland]buddhism),and then in 760,became his master's mokudai(deputy).
commencing with todai-ji temple,he took part in the planning of construction of saidai-ji temple and sairyu-ji temple in nara.
he had the halo made for the great buddha at todai-ji temple,nara,as well as building a shotoden to store the hyakumanto(known as the hyakumanto dharani:the one million pagodas and dharani prayers)and zuto(pyramid-like pagoda made of clay and stone).
subsequently,he successively held various posts at todai-ji temple,including jishu(literally,head priest,referring to director of the temple or abbot),joza(literally,elder or president,referring to an ecclesiastical official,one of the three officials who assumes leadership in the affairs of a monastery)and zojisho-chiji(literally,director of affairs of temple construction department)among todaiji shochin and sanko(or sango,literally,the three bonds,referring to the directors of a monastery),thus playing an active part in handling practical business matters for the temple.
jicchu was supposedly the one who commenced the juichimen[kannon]keka-e(the repentance ceremony of eleven-faced kannon,commonly known as shuni-e or omizutori)at the nigatsu-do(literally,hall of the second month)of the todai-ji temple.
his writings include "todaiji gon-no-betto jicchu nijukyu kajo" (literally,the 29 rules prescribed by jicchu,acting chief of the todai-ji temple)dated 815,where he enumerated the work he had undertaken during his lifetime.
