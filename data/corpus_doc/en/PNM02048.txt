koremune no tadayasu
koremune tadayasu(also known as uemon no jo hashiguchi,year of birth unknown-1179?)was a descendent of the hata clan and a samurai of kyoto,who served sekkan-ke(namely,the families which produced the regent and the chief adviser to the emperor).
his wife was tango no tsubone(from the hiki clan)
his sons were tadahiro(kazusa no kuni no zenji[the former governor of kazusa province]),tadahisa(bungo no kuni no kami[governor of bungo province]),and tadasue(hyoe no jo[lieutenant of the middle palace guards]).
there is a theory that tadahisa shimazu was adopted koremune no hirokoto together with tadasue,because hirokoto took tango no tsubone to wife later.
