sotaro masuda
sotaro masuda(march 17,1849-september,1877)was the legitimate eldest son of hisayuki masuda,a noncommissioned officer of nakatsu-han(nakatsu domain).
his mother was the daughter of shigena watanabe who was one of the three experts in kokugaku(the study of japanese classical literature)in the kyusyu area.
his father was the cousin of the wife of hyakusuke fukuzawa.
he studied kokugaku(provincial schools)and had the thought that the foreigners should be expelled.
he was the younger second cousin of yukichi fukuzawa,and they lived close to each other as well as they were close friends.
however,when fukuzawa came back to his hometown in 1870,masuda planned to assassinate fukuzawa in his sleep.
however,since fukuzawa drank all night with his guest,gorobe hattori,his plan did not succeed.
there are different stories on this matter as well.
after the meiji restoration,he gave up his position on the expulsion of foreigners,and joined the freedom and people's rights movement.
he participated in the seinan war on the side of satsu-gun(satsuma army),and led nakatsu tai(nakatsu squad).
after being defeated at the battle of wada-toge,saigo ordered the dissolution of the military and some soldiers went back to their hometown,but he stayed with saigo.
the phrase that ryotaro shiba quoted in his book, 'if you spend one day with your mentor,you will have the love of one day,and if 3 days,you will have the love of 3 days',was what masuda said.
it is said that he was killed during the battle of shiroyama or he was caught and beheaded.
during the pacific war,fukuzawa,who promoted western thought,was not supported,and thus masuda who tried to kill him became highly evaluated and a shrine was even built at the site of his birthplace.
after the war,his evaluation was turned back,and there is a small park on the site of masuda's birthplace now.
