han-noh
"han-noh" is a style of "nohgaku" that a play is performed with largely shortened "maeba" (the first half of the drama),focusing on "nochiba",(the second half of the drama)for "tsukeshugen" (a short celebratory noh play).
the purpose is to shorten the performance duration and to emphasize on words of congratulations.
see "tsukeshugen" for reference.
from the reason above,normally "han-noh" is only performed as "waki noh" (noh plays in which central character is god)or "shugen-mono" (celebratory piece of noh play)for "gobanme-mono" (fifth-category plays).
it is not played with one-scene noh play.
the style of "han-noh" shortens "maeba" scenes after initial "shidai" (one of component parts of a noh play)or "dan" (a section)including "nanori" (announcement of one's name)and "michiyuki" (going on a road)of "waki" (supporting actor),and performs scenes after machi-utai(a song sung by a waki in the middle of a noh play).
this is a content,which can be called "maibayashi" (an abbreviated style of noh)with "waki" and shozoku(costume).
now "gobandate" (five sections of a noh play)is no longer played,therefore performance opportunity is much less than before.
on the other hand some pieces,such as "shakkyo" (stone bridge,noh play),are played more often in han-noh style.
also there are some pieces like "shojo" (monkey like animal in legend)and "iwafune" (a boat-like rock),which are played in han-noh style too often that finally han-noh style became their formal performance style.
