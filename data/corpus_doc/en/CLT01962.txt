hikae yagura
hikae yagura is zamoto(leaders of theatrical companies)which took over the performance rights and ran the theaters on behalf of the playhouses(hon yagura[the three licensed theaters,edo sanza])authorized by the edo bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)because the playhouses could not give any performance due to financial woes etc.in the edo period.
only edo sanza(nakamura-za theater,ichimura-za theater and morita-za theater)were licensed to run kabuki theaters,and their hikae yagura were miyako-za theater,kiri-za theater and kawarazaki-za theater respectively.
it is said that the playhouses faced continued financial difficulties due to a series of fires and reconstruction activities in the edo period.
