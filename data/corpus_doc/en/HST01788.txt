sanyo-kai(three-day-a-week group)
sanyo-kai is a parliamentary group of the house of peers(japan)in the meiji period(march 24,1891-february 20,1899).
it was founded in march 1891,added new members such as the peerage and large taxpaying members of diet as well as original members,incumbent members of the house of peers to the doshi-kai that had been founded in november 4,1890,making out the voluntary document and rules stipulating that it should hold assemblies on every monday,wednesday and friday(the name of the group 'sanyo' [three-day-a-week]derived from that).
the main members of diet were atsumaro konoe and motohiro nijo who were the peerage,and a member of diet by imperial command,goro miura.
it advocated the neutrality between the government and minto(general term of the political parties such as liberal party,progressive party and so on which conflicted with a han-dominated government when imperial diet was inaugurated)of the house of representatives and argued that the government and parties such as minto should collaborate and form 'a responsible cabinet' to work on the internal and external matters for the national interest and people's welfare.
later it supported a hard-line foreign policy collaborating with the konwa-kai of tateki tani and the constitutional progressive party of minto,and criticized government for its policy of transcendentalism,han-dominated politics and treaty revision.
after many candidates were defeated in the first mutual election of members of diet in 1897,it declined and in 1899,it was merged into the large taxpaying members of diet group,asahi club.
