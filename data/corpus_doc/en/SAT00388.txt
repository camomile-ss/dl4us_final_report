its old classification of shrines was prefectural shrine(of prefectures other than kyoto and osaka),as well as beppyo jinja(shrines on the special list).

history
the shrine has been reportedly constructed by kanjo(ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location)from iwashimizu hachimangu under the imperial decree of emperor gosanjo based on the desire of minamoto no yoshiie in the late heian period(1069).
in the sengoku period(period of warring states)it decayed in the war flames but was revived by hideyoshi toyotomi,the lord of the nagahama-jo castle(omi province).
since the heian period,the shinhojyo-ji temple,the bettoji(a temple attached to a shrine),had been stood in the precincts of a shrine,however,it was abandoned by the ordinance distinguishing shinto and buddhism in the early meiji period.
the buddha statue and materials were all moved to the shana-in temple of a branch temple which was left alone.
