urajiro-toge pass
urajiro-toge pass is a pass located between koga city in shiga prefecture and ujitawara town in kyoto prefecture.
it is an old road of route 307 and it required early improvement since it was a traffic choke point which had continuous steep slopes and sharp curves.
however,the traffic bottleneck was relieved after the opening of new bypass which was approximately 2km including chaya tunnel(390m in length).
