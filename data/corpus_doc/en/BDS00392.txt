a small statue of buddha which is placed on the head of buddha statue or bosatsu statue or on its halo,and a small image of buddha or picture on the ceiling are also called kebutsu.
in the case of bosatsu,the buddha statue on the head is called kebutsu in order to show honji-butsu(original buddhist divinity).

in addition,the 16 buddha statues on the halo of the statue of rushana-butsu(rushana buddha)in the todai-ji temple are also kebutsu,and the 6 amida nyorai(amitabha tathagata)statues which are thrown out of the mouth of the kuya shonin statue in the rokuharamitsu-ji temple in kyoto are also said to be a kind of kebutsu.
moreover,the horse statue on the head of bato kannon(horse-headed kannon),although it is not a buddha statue,is also called kebutsu.
it is said that when shakyamuni preached,a thousand lights and a thousand kebutsu appeared from shakyamuni's byakugo(whorl of hair in the centre of the forehead of buddha),which has been often adopted as a subject of buddhist paintings.
