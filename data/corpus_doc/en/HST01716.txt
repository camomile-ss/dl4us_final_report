choji-ya
choji-ya(丁子屋)is one of the oldest yago(trade name),which is confirmed to have already existed in the edo period.
there is another writing variation for 'choji-ya' (丁字屋).
this trade name derived from choji(a clove tree),and it was used by shoka(mercantile house)whose kamon(family crest)contained a design of cloves.
additionally,there were cases that merchants whose business were related to choji(clove oil,perfume,and herbal medicines)used the yago.
the usage of the yago of choji-ya has also spread to trades related to plants(indigo-dyeing shops).
clove oil was used to take care of japanese swords and its perfumes and herbal medicines were also not cheap during the edo period.
as a result,although there were a lot of shoka under the name of choji-ya,many of them had a certain level of business capital.
accordingly,there are still such shops which are keeping their noren(a short,split curtain hung at the entrance of a store,which now represents the stores' goodwill and credit)in various places even after the meiji restoration.
