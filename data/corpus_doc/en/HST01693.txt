ekitei-shi(government office in charge of transportation and communication)
ekitei-shi is a government office in charge of transportation and communication,formed on june 11,1868.
it was later renamed as ekitei-ryo/ekitei-kyoku and became the former body of teishin-sho(ministry of communication).
it was established under kaikei-kan(ministry of finance),when kaikei-kan was created based on the constitution of 1868.
next year,it was moved with minbu-sho(ministry of popular affairs),and played a part in virtual okura-and-minbu-sho(which actually remained as two separate ministries in the government organization-minbu-sho and okura-sho(ministry of finance)-,but virtually functioned as one)
on april 20,1871,officials from ekitei-shi,including hisoka maejima and jo sugiura,launched the postal system.
in the same year,minbu-sho was integrated with okura-sho,and elevated to be ekitei-ryo(according to the change of the government system from ryo to kyoku in january 1877,it changed its name to ekitei-kyoku).
the importance of the postal system has increased as it added exchange system(postal money order)in january 1875 and banking service(postal savings)in may.
it was also a part of ekitei-shi's responsibility to reform the transportation system,which was caused by the abolition of sukego system(tax system imposed to villages based on their amount of crop,and paid in labor;villages designated as sukego had to provide laborers,horses and sometimes sailors to help their neighboring post-station town)in the shogunate system.
on the other hand,ekitei-kyoku itself became independent as a newly established teishin-sho in 1885,after it had been moved to naimu-sho(prewar ministry of home affairs),which had separated from okura-sho in 1874,and then to no-shomu-sho(ministry of agriculture and commerce),which had separated from naimu-sho in 1881.
