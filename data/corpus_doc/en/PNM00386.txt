fujifusa madenokoji
fujifusa madenokoji(1296-may 11,1380)was a japanese court noble who lived in the kamakura period and the period of the northern and southern courts.
his father was nobufusa madenokoji.
he served the emperor godaigo as a close aide and took part in a plot to overthrow the kamakura bakufu(japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
it is said that he recommended the use of masashige kusunoki in the genko incident.
later,he was caught and exiled to shimousa province.
after the kenmu no shinsei(kenmu restoration),he returned and became a chunagon(vice-councilor of state),but,although he admonished the emperor for an administration in which only close aides were treated favorably,the emperor would not hear it and,therefore,he became disappointed in the new government and became a priest,retiring and moving to iwakura in the suburb of kyoto where his final whereabouts became unknown.
according to a certain view,juo sohitsu,who was the second chief priest of the myoshin-ji temple,was the same person as fujifusa madenokoji and there are many different views that he died in mikawa province,or in hitachi province,or that he died in dewa province(masumi sugae's view that fujifusa madenokoji became the second chief priest,muto ryoyu of the hoda-ji temple in matsubara mura,sannnai,akita-gun).
