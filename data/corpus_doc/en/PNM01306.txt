inuo
inuo(year of birth unknown-1413)was the dayu(master)of omi sarugaku hieza(hie guild of sarugaku(comical mimicry and speech performance in heian period)in omi province)that was active during the same period as kanami.
he shared a popularity along side kanami and zeami of kanze-za(kanze guild)as a skillful actor of the noh play.
he was also known as the 'doami' of amigo(ami title).
summary
although his birth year is uncertain,it is believed that he was of the same age or slightly younger than kanami from his performing period.
in contrast to yamato sarugaku(sarugaku from yamato province)that mainly focused in the mimicry,he often expressed the artistic style of omi sarugaku that focused greatly on popular utamai(a performance of singing and dancing)and gathered great popularity.
he temporarily lost favor of yoshimitsu ashikaga,but was pardoned later and received a one character name from the homyo(buddhist name)of yoshimitsu and made his 'inuami' of amigo into 'doami.'
the favor from yoshimitsu did not weaken until the end of his life and when emperor gokomatsu visited kitayama-dai(kitayama residence),he performed noh play with the emperor in attendance.
he adored and respected kanami,who was the pioneer of sarugaku noh,and held a memorial service for the dead on the death date on the 19th.
zeami regarded him highly,and stated in "sarugaku dangi" (talks about sarugaku)that, 'inuo is the best performer to have realized yugen(the subtle and profound)in noh,and he will never be surpassed'.
according to the paper, 'study of tennyomai' (the dance of the heavenly maiden)by mikio takemoto in the 20th century,zeami incorporated 'tennyomai' that inuo was skilled in and increased the creativity to his play.
