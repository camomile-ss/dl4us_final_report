history
the origin of the kumano-fude is said to be that,at the end of the edo period,farmers who worked as seasonal migrant workers in yamato province during the agricultural off-season purchased writing brushes and ink in nara prefecture on the way back home and then peddled them,as well as produced them on their own to sell,and later its manufacturing developed with the help of incentives for industry from hiroshima domain.
production of the kumano-fude increased as education became widely available after the meiji era began.
its market share grew to the top,with as much as 80%of the total domestic production.
painting brushes and cosmetic brushes started to be produced after wwii and were certified as a traditional craft in 1975.
on the other hand,recently,there are several issues on the kumano-fude,such as imported writing brushes from china or other countries and a limited number of successors.
