seven great temples of nanto(nara)
seven great temples of nanto are the seven major temples that existed in heijo-kyo(nanto,nara)and its surrounding areas in the nara period and were protected by the imperial court.
kofuku-ji temple(nara city)
todai-ji temple(nara city)
saidai-ji temple(nara city)
yakushi-ji temple(nara city)
gango-ji temple(nara city)
daian-ji temple(nara city)
horyu-ji temple(ikaruga-cho,ikoma county)
since horyu-ji temple is located in ikaruga,some theories exclude horyu-ji temple as one of the seven and instead count toshodai-ji temple.
another theory excepts saidai-ji temple from the list and adds venerable gufuku-ji temple(present-day kawahara-dera temple)from a historic point of view,which suggests that the listing of great temples started from four temples and expanded later.
