gohei
gohei is one type of heihaku used in the religious services of shinto,made by clipping two shide(zigzag strips of paper)into a heigushi(staff)made of bamboo or other wood.
also called heisoku or nusa.
while usual shide strips are made from white paper,those to be clipped into to gohei can be five-color paper,gold foil or silver foil in addition to white paper.
originally,offerings of fuhaku(cotton,silk,textile fabrics)were presented to the god by clipping them into a wood staff,and this practice forms the origin for today's customary gohei.
originally an offering to the god,gohei later stood within the sanctuary and came to be viewed as a yorishiro(object representative of a divine spirit)or a shintai(object in which the spirit of a divine spirit resides),or were used as implements,like haraegushi,with which to purify worshipers at the shrine.
a gohei with several heisoku stripes attached to a long wood or bamboo stick is specifically called bonten.
