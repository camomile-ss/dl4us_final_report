brief personal history
his mother,ishi,died soon after the emperor was born,and then he was then taken and raised by his grandfather,the cloistered emperor shirakawa.
he succeeded to the throne when he was five,after the death of his father,the emperor horikawa.
the cloistered emperor shirakawa took actual control of the government.
in 1117,the cloistered emperor shirakawa's adopted daughter,fujiwara no shoshi(taiken mon in),made her bridal entry as an imperial consort into the court,whereupon she became the second consort of the emperor,and had five boys and two girls.
on january 23,1123,the eldest child,emperor sutoku,succeeded to the throne;however,after this the cloistered emperor shirakawa retained control of the government.
after the cloistered emperor shirakawa died,emperor toba started ruling his cloister government in 1129.
the emperor called back fujiwara no tadazane,who was disfavored by the cloistered emperor shirakawa,and he then arranged his daughter,fujiwara no taishi(kaya no in)an imperial consort's bridal entry into the court,and filled all the significant posts with his close aides.
furthermore,the emperor loved fujiwara no tokushi(bifuku mon in),taking over as the second consort of the emperor,shoshi who lost support from the cloister government goshirakawa,and appointed his son,prince narihito(the emperor konoe)to succeed the throne.
he held control of the politics for 28 years,during the three generations from emperor sutoku,emperor konoe and emperor goshirakawa.
in 1142 he became a cloistered emperor after being ordained as a buddhist priest by receiving the orders of buddhism at todai-ji temple kaidan in[the building that houses the 'ordination platform'].
he disfavored the retired emperor sutoku since he followed empress bifuku mon in,and indirectly caused the hogen war just after the death of the cloistered emperor toba.
