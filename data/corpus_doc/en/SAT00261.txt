history
temple legend states that gantoku-ji temple was founded in modern day terato-cho,muko city in the year 679 before chukai(son of late heian period samurai taira no norimori)who had served at hobodai-in temple in sanjo-dori street,higashioji-dori street became head priest and restored the temple.
the temple prospered as the central temple of tendai sect esoteric buddhism but went into decline due to factors including destruction by fire.
it further deteriorated in modern times and in 1962 artifacts including the principal image statue of kannon were relocated to shoji-ji temple,known as 'hana no tera' (lit.flower temple).
following this,gantoku-ji temple was moved adjacent to shoji-ji temple and restored.
