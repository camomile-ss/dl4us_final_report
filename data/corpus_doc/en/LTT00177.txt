the main theme focuses on the love affairs between hamamatsu chunagon,the main character and various ladies;such as a tragic love with daihime,a daughter of his stepfather,sadaisho,and then,a love and parting with the empress in tang(china)where he went to see his dead father who visited his dream and telling him that he reincarnated as a prince of tang.
they are paranormal love stories based on dream visions and rinne tensho(all things being in flux through the endless circle of birth,death,and rebirth-the circle of transmigration).
