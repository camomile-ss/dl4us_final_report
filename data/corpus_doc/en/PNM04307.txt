his clan of the same age included iki no hakatoko,who engaged in issuing taiho ritsuryo(taiho code),together with fujiwara no fuhito and so forth,and wrote "document by iki no hatatoko," one of the few ancient documents.
according to "shoku nihongi" (chronicle of japan continued),komaro,together with kose no oji,was given cotton,hemp,a hoe and hulled rice by emperor monmu because komaro,whose rank was still juhachiinoge(junior eighth rank,lower grade),went to an isolated place as an emperor's envoy on june 23,707.
"shoku nihongi"also said that kose no oji and others,who had visited tang dynasty china as japanese envoys,came back to japan on april 12,707;it is not clear but komaro might have been to tang with them.
