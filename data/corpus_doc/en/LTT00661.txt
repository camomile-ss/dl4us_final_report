shizu no iwaya
shizu no iwaya is a sea cave(approximately 45 m deep and 13 m high)created by coastal erosion in uotsu,shizuma-cho,oda-shi,shimane prefecture.
also called "shizu ga iwaya."
it is a natural monument designated by oda city.
izumo shinwa(myths of izumo)includes a folklore that okuninushi no mikoto and sukunahikona no mikoto used a stone cave as their temporary house during the development of the land.
there is a theory that shizu no iwaya could be the one that was depicted in a oishi no suguri no mahito's poem in manyoshu(volume 3-355) "onamuchi and sukunahikona lived in shizu no iwaya;how many generations that have been passed by?"
based on these legends,a stone monument with inscription by iesato tokugawa is built at shizu no iwaya.
in the past,the shizuma shrine resided in this place but it was relocated to avoid high waves to tarumi,shizuma-cho,oda-shi in 1656.
it should be noted that it is currently prohibited to enter shizu no iwaya because it is in danger of collapse.
