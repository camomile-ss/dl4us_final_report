it is drawn as a waterfall like figure made with a rag,and according to its explanation,it is a transformed old dish towel.
it is a specter of sekien's creation,and he parodied the name from a character's name, 'shiroururi',in "tsurezure gusa" (essays in idleness)by kenko yoshida.
the books about specters published in recent years often contains an explanation that old cleaning rag or dish towel transforms into this specter and attacks humans with unpleasant mucus and emitting an offensive odor,making people faint.
however the description originated from tale of monster of old cleaning rag called 'revenge of old cleaning rag',told in "tohoku kaidan no tabi" (trip to the scary stories in tohoku region)by norio yamada,a novelist.
