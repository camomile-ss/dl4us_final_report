the tennin statues with wings which was began around persia were also regarded as a symbol of the spirit(furuwashi)which fly around the air in zoroastrianism,and its figures are seen in ancient persian ruins such as taqi bustan(sassanid empire)and pasargadae(ruin of the place of cyrus the great).
these figures were spread in egypt and mesopotamia,and gave influenced the states of deities with wings such as an angel in israel and eros and nike in greece.
the characteristic of hiten in buddhism is that it does not have wings,which differentiate it from those deities of orient region.
