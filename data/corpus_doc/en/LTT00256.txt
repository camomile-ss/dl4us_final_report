sakanoue no korenori
sakanoue no korenori(date of birth unknown-930)was a japanese poet of the early and the mid-heian period.
sakanoue no yoshikage,his father,was the grandson of sakanoue no kiyono who was the third son of sakanoue no tamuramaro(there is also a theory that yoshikage was the grandson of sakanoue no hirono,the second son of tamuramaro).
sakanoue no mochiki,one of the 'nashitsubo no gonin' (five gentlemen of the pear chamber)and who selected waka for the 'gosen wakashu' (later selected collection of japanese poetry),was his son.
he is one of the sanjurokkasen(36 immortal poets).
after filling the posts of yamato no gonnoshojo(provisional junior secretary of yamato province),shonaiki(junior secretary of ministry of the central affairs)and dainaiki(senior secretary of the ministry of central affairs),he ended his career as jugoinoge(junior fifth rank,lower grade),kaga no suke(assistant governor of kaga province)in 924.
he often contributed poems on events related to waka poetry during the reign of the emperor uda and the emperor daigo such as the 'kanpyo no kisai no miya no uta-awase' (poetry contest held by the consort in the kanpyo era)and 'oigawa gyoko waka' (the waka from the sovereign's excursion to the oi-gawa river),and was the next best poet after the compilers of 'kokin wakashu' (a collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry).
he was also said to have excelled not only at waka poetry but also kemari(the ancient football game of the japanese imperial court).
his poems were selected for chokusen wakashu(anthologies of poems collected by imperial command)starting when 'kokin wakashu' was compiled and onwards.
he left a personal collection 'korenori shu.'
