<e type="check" ver="1">Saga Books (Sagabon) are books printed using movable type at the beginning of the early-modern period of Japan.</e>
<cmt>My revision is a bit 意訳 but it communicates the same information as the Japanese, I think. I have left &quot;(kokatsuji-ban)&quot; in the text, but is the Japanese for &quot;movable type&quot; necessary?</cmt>

<cmt>Reworded the sentence to make the merchant class and the craftsmen the &quot;existing base of readers&quot; (I think this is what the original Japanese meant to say). Also, &quot;from the Gozanban (Five Mountains Editions) &quot; is fairly confusing but I left it according to the research the original translator did.</cmt>

<cmt>Replaced &quot;and close to&quot; with &quot;friend of&quot; as this makes the sentence read a little smoother and is perhaps a closer translation of 「交友」. Cut &quot;which were the old movable type imprints called Sagabon&quot; and replaced the earlier &quot;books&quot; with &quot;Sagabon&quot; (since there is already an explanation of it elsewhere I didn&apos;t think readers needed to be informed again)</cmt>
