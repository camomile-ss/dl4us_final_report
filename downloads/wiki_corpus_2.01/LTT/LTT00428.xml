<e type="check" ver="1">The History of Classical Japanese Literature</e>
<cmt>中古→medieval　とすると、「中世」という意味になってしまうのでは、と思います。日本の中世は鎌倉時代以降を指すようですので、ここでは平安時代を指す中古文学の訳に適さないのではと思います。他のサイトを見ると、「中古」は「平安時代」を指していることが多いようです。The checker&apos;s argument makes sense to me and the Kenkyusha online dictionary actually gives &quot;Heian literature&quot; as a possible translation for &quot;中古文学&quot;. Unfortunately, however, the following sentence doesn&apos;t really make sense if this is used. I think &quot;classical&quot; works better than &quot;medieval&quot;, though, so I have edited this accordingly.</cmt>
