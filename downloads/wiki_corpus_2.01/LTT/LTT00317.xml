<cmt>「永長２年七月」 began August 10th, and ended September 8th, 1097, so I changed July 1097 to August 1097; 「承徳３年正月から３月案」 is January 24 - April 22, so I changed &quot;January to March&quot; to &quot;January to April&quot;; 「永長元年」 is in 1096, so I fixed this, but I am unclear if 「三七」 means &quot;March to July&quot;...; Perhaps it would be easier just to not translate the months since it is impossible to be entirely accurate without translating the Japanese time periods in every case?; fixed grammar</cmt>
