<j>足利将軍家や畠山氏、斯波氏の家督争いなどから発展した「応仁の乱」を中心に、その原因と洛中の合戦の様子や東軍細川勝元と西軍山名持豊(宗全)の死までが記されている軍記物語。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">It is a war tale focused on the &apos;Onin War&apos; that developed out of the succession disputes within the Ashikaga Shogunal family, the Hatakeyama clan, and the Shiba clan, recounting it from its causes, through all the battles fought in and around the capital, up until the deaths of Katsumoto HOSOKAWA of the eastern forces and Mochitoyo (Sozen) YAMANA of the western forces.</e>
<cmt>足利将軍家の「将軍」は形容詞に近いのでthe Ashikaga Shogunal familyとしました。</cmt>
<e type="trans" ver="2">It is a war chronicle focusing on the Onin War that developed out of inheritence disputes within the Ashikaga Shogunal family, the Hatakeyama clan, and the Shiba clan, recounting everything from its origins, through all the battles fought in and around the capital, up until the deaths of Katsumoto HOSOKAWA of the eastern forces and Mochitoyo (Sozen) YAMANA of the western forces.</e>
<cmt>I didn&apos;t think &quot;tale&quot; captured the nuance of 「軍記物語」 so I changed it to &quot;chronicle&quot;. Changed &quot;focussed&quot; to &quot;focussing&quot;, &quot;succession disputes&quot; to &quot;inheritance disputes&quot; and &quot;recounting it from its causes&quot; to &quot;recounting everything from its origins&quot; as I felt these made the sentence read a little more naturally, and that including &quot;everything&quot; captured the meaning of the Japanese better.. Also took &quot;Onin War&quot; out of quotation marks as I didn&apos;t feel they were necessary.</cmt>

<cmt>Added &quot;a span of&quot; &quot;the contents cover&quot; to make the sentence read a bit more smoothly, removed comma after &quot;Muromachi peroid&quot; as it seemed uneccessary. Took &quot;Yamatai shi&quot; out of apostrophes. Also replaced &quot;describing the wars&quot; with &quot;and describe the wars&quot; to prevent the repetition of &quot;describing&quot;.</cmt>
