<cmt>原文に合わせて全体を訳し直しました。&quot;Hogen edict&quot; is a 仮訳 as it doesn&apos;t get many hits but I can&apos;t think of any other way to describe this. Please note that although the Japanese does not specify whose political authority was to be strengthened, the English seems a little unnatural without this information so I have added &quot;of the Imperial Court&quot;. Please check if I have understood this correctly. Also, if the checker feels that a translation is in some way inaccurate, it would be helpful if he/she could try to fix the problem.</cmt>
