<cmt>revised for clarity, but it&apos;s not clear how the messengers relayed their messages to Saio/Itsukinomiko. Where were the messages handed over and who received the messages? Where did Saio/Itsukinomiko go and where did she come back from?[From Translator]I could not tell from the original Japanese sentence where the first messenger was sent from and sent to, but Japanese word, 奉幣使 has a meaning of messenger who is sent to the Shrine, so I think the first messenger was sent to Shinto shrine of Itsukinomiya but could not tell where he or she was sent from.</cmt>
