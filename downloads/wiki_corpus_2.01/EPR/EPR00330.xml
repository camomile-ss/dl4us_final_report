<cmt>Joined to prevent sentence fragment. Best to use &quot;ca.&quot; for &quot;?&quot; after dates in the source.I&apos;m not sure where the translator got the translation for 斎宮 from but as the general meaning of consecrated is &quot;to officially make (something) holy and suitable to be used for religious ceremonies&quot;, it doesn&apos;t seem appropriate to me. I have based the explanation in parentheses on the entry in the database.</cmt>
