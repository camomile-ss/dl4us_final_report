<cmt>文法。 “so he had all the support from” 日本語で「全面的支援」となっているが、英語では「何に対する支援」と明確にすることが必要。I have edited this to make it read a little more smoothly, but I don&apos;t think there is any need to specify what the support was in regard to. For one thing, the Japanese doesn&apos;t tell us and for another it seems clear to me that because Sonno had married his daughter, Bifuku mon in would support Sonno whenever necessary.</cmt>
