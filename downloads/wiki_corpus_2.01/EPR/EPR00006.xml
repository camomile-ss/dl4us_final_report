<cmt>主述関係がわかりにくい。I don&apos;t think there is much that can be done to make this easier to follow if it remains as one sentence. As the sentence is so long, I have broken it in two so that the client can decide which they would prefer. Please note that I have made some other changes (such as putting &quot;Imperial Prince Yasuhito&quot; in parentheses) to make them read more smoothly. I have had to introduce some extra commas but I don&apos;t think a native speaker of English would have any trouble following the revised version.</cmt>
