<cmt>「百姓層の階層分化が進み」を訳文に反映して訳し直しました。。Please ask the translator to write full sentences that follow the conventions of English grammar. &quot;However, at that time, change in social situation;&quot; is a sentence fragment and makes no sense (the fact that it is followed by a semi-colon does not change this fact). It would also be helpful if the native checker could leave a comment such as &quot;sentence fragment--requires retranslation&quot; if he/she comes across such problems.</cmt>
