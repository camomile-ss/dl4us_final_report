<cmt>原文に沿うように訳し直しました。Part of the problem is that the original translation is very ambiguous: there is no certain record left of what? This could be read as meaning that there were no certain records left concerning any of the aforementioned events. But reading the Japanese suggests to me that there were no certain records left concerning what happened after the aforementioned events.</cmt>
