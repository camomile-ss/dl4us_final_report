<e type="trans" ver="2">Although the Emperor had already passed away, his stick for a priest created a scary space and Sojun IKKYU who was under his discipline period fell into the space.</e>
<cmt>not sure what &quot;stick&quot; is, and how it creates a &quot;space&quot; that Sojun IKKYU fell into? Perhaps a more clearly defined explanation is needed here?</cmt>
<e type="check" ver="1">Although the Emperor had already passed away, the staff he had used during his time as a priest was found one day by Sojun IKKYU, a young Buddhist novice, and this staff opened up a portal to a kind of hell dimension that Sojun then fell into.</e>
