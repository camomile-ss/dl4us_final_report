<cmt>It&apos;s great that the translator has taken the time to provide explanations for terms that the reader would otherwise have trouble understanding. In this case, however, I&apos;m not sure that the ritsuryosei can be described as the &quot;ancient East Asian system of centralized governance&quot; as, although it was based on the Chinese system, I don&apos;t think this particular system was introduced in any other Asian countries was it?</cmt>
