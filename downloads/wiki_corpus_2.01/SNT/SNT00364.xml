<j>古事記の説話的部分が概ね武烈天皇のあたりで終わっておりその後はほとんど系譜のみの記述となること、また日本書紀の記述もこのあたりで大きく性格が変わり、具体的な日時をあまり含まない説話的な記述を中心としたものからきちんと日時の入った記録をもとにした記述中心に変わっていると見られる等の理由から「旧辞」の内容はこのあたりで終わり、その後まもなくそれまでもともと口承で伝えられてきた「旧辞」が6世紀ころに文書化されたものであると考えた。</j>

<j>また古事記の序文などにはそれぞれ名前は微妙に異なるものの、ほとんどの場合に『帝紀』と『旧辞』をはじめとして二つの史書が並べて記されていることなどから、これらは単に別々のものを並べているのではなくもともと組み合わせることを前提に作られた一体のものであり、二つの史書を組み合わせた中国の紀伝体とは異なる「日本式の紀伝体」とでもいうべき形態が存在するのではないかとする見方もある。</j>
