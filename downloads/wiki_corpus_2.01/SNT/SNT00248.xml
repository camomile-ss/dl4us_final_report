<cmt>As the meaning of &quot;Saijin&quot; has already been explained, I don&apos;t think the information in parentheses is necessary. I agree with the translator that the Japanese seems very unclear so although the English will likewise seem unclear, there is nothing we can do about it.</cmt>

<e type="trans" ver="1">Shinto has its origin in nature worship, enshrining seas, mountains or rivers as shintai (object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity) and in early Shinto shrines, such enshrined deities have no particular names, or their names were unknown.</e>

<cmt>Given that Shintai is defined in the translation as meaning an object of worship *housed* in a shrine, saying that shrines enshrine seas etc. makes it sound like seas are physically housed at the shrine. As a result, I have had to &quot;massage&quot; the definition of &quot;shintai&quot; here. Please check.</cmt>

<cmt>As far as I know, 記紀 is a Japanese term used to refer to the 古事記 and 日本書紀 and not the name of an actual book itself so it doesn&apos;t really seem necessary to use this term in the translation. It makes more sense to just give the names of the two books it actually refers to.</cmt>
