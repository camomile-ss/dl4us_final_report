<j>それまでの新制は、従来から行われてきた法令の性格を残した「新しい禁制」としての新制に留まっていたのに対し、長保元年令は中世における新制公布の最大の動機である天人相関説に由来する攘災と政治再建のための「徳政」の推進という理念に基づいて定められた最初のものであった。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">While shinsei before Chohogannenrei was no more than a &quot;new ban&quot; which retained characteristics of the former laws, Chohogannenrei was the first to be established based on the idea of promotion of &quot;virtuous rule&quot; for eradicating disaster and rehabilitating politics, originating from tenjin sokansetsu (one of ancient Chinese views of the world and political thought, the theory that there is close relationship between human action or political affairs, personnel affairs and natural phenomenon), which was the main motivation for issuing shinsei in the medieval period.</e>

<j>治承・建久の2度の新制の制定に大臣・摂関として関わった九条兼実（道長の6代目の子孫）は｢長保以後代々制符｣が制符（新制）策定の基本であるべきであると度々主張（『玉葉』治承2年4月23日・6月5日条）しており、長保から200年経た後世においても長保元年令が新制の出発点になるとする考え方が公家社会に広く存在し、中世公家法に対して強い影響を与えたことが分かる。</j>
