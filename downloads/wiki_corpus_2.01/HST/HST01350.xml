<j>この声明書の中で、「これまでの朝鮮の歴史の悲劇は自分達が招いたことであり、我が国の皇帝陛下と日本天皇陛下に懇願し、朝鮮人も日本人と同じ一等国民の待遇を享受して、政府と社会を発展させようではないか」と、大韓帝国と大日本帝国が新たに一つの政治機関を設立し、大韓帝国と大日本帝国が対等合邦して一つの大帝国を作るように求めた。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">In the statement, it says &apos;Tragedies in Korean history are our own fault, so we would like to plead to our Emperor and the Emperor of Japan to give Koreans the opportunity to enjoy the same treatment as the first class citizens of Japan. We ask the Japanese to develop our government and society&apos; and suggest the Korean Empire and the Empire of Japan establish a new unified political body together and create a new empire by equal merger of both Empires.</e>

<j>南北朝鮮では当時一進会が民衆のみならず知識人からも強い批判を受けていたこと、それまで一進会が同じくチンイルパの李完用首相と共に日本の朝鮮侵出を援護してきたことなどから、この声明書に対して「国権防衛運動、義兵闘争、愛国啓蒙運動などに反するもの」であると非常に批判的である。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">Because the Iljinhoe group were receiving strong criticism not only from the general public but also from intellectuals at that time and the group was back Japan&apos;s invasion of Korea together with another Chinilpa Prime Minister Lee Wan-Yong, in North and South Korea, people were fiercely critical toward this statement as &apos;a view opporsing the protection of national sovereignty, the effort of the Righteous Army (Korean army) and promotion of patriotism&apos;.</e>
<cmt>「義兵」はいろいろなサイトで&quot;Righteous Army&quot;と訳されているようですが、それだけではネイティブには分かりにくいかも知れませんので&quot;Korean army&quot;としました。</cmt>

<j>ただ日本を含めた諸外国の研究者は、一進会が大日本帝国の侵略の意図を見抜けず韓国を亡国へと導く役割を果たしたことは事実であるが、対等合併論自体は日本の朝鮮併合論（朝鮮が日本に従属し、主権を放棄する形で植民地となる。）とは明らかに異なり、寧ろ併合後の日本が一進会すらも用済みとして切捨て、植民地統治を開始したことを踏まえて、「一進会もまた犠牲者であり、必ずしも責められるべき点ばかりではなかった」とする同情的意見も強い。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">However, many researchers of other countries including Japan, have sympathetic views stating that, although it is true that the Iljinhoe group played a role making Korea a lost country without foreseeing the Empire of Japan&apos;s intension of invasion, their theory of equal merger was totally different from Japan&apos;s theory of Korean annexation (Korea comes under the rule of Japan to become a colony by relinquishing sovereign power), so considering Japan discarded the Iljinhoe after the group served their purpose, &apos;the Iljinhoe were also victims and should not be totally blamed&apos;.</e>
