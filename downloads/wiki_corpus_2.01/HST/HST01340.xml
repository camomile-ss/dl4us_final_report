<j>理由はこの両名が武田勝頼と内通していたという訴えが五徳姫より信長にもたらされたためであるが、当時、もはや盟友とは名ばかりであり、実質的に織田を盟主とする従属国であった家康には信長の要求を拒否し、同盟を破棄して戦うだけの実力も無かったため、家康は要求に従って信康と築山殿を処刑するしかなかったと言われている（もっとも、この時期信康と家康、厳密に言えば家康家臣団との対立が激しくなっており、信康粛清は信長の要求ではないとする説が近年では有力視されている）。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">The reason is that Gotokuhime (Princess Toku) told Nobunaga that Nobuyasu and Tsukiyama-dono secretly communicated with Katsuyori TAKEDA; at that time the relationship of sworn alliance in equal terms was just nominal; practically, the provinces Ieyasu controlled were dependency of Nobunaga; therefore, he had no power to abolish the alliance and to fight; thus, he had no way but to execute Nobuyasu and Tsukiyama-dono (At the time the confrontation of Nobuyasu and Ieyasu, more precisely Nobuyasu and the vassals of Ieyasu was getting intense; therefore, in recent years a theory which advocates that the purge of Nobuyasu was not the demand made by Nobunaga is getting dominant).</e>
