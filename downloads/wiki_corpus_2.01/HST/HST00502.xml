<j>第一は、最高裁は、捜査としての写真撮影を適法に行うためには、(1)現行犯的状況、(2)証拠保全の必要性・緊急性、(3)相当性という3つの要件が備わっていなければならない、という基準を示したのだ、という解釈である。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">First, it was interpreted that the Supreme Court showed the criterion that photographing as the investigation activity legally required the three conditions as follows: (1) Circumstances in which a crime is being committed or it does not seem long since a crime was committed (2) There is an urgent need for preservation of evidence (3) Photographs taken by an appropriate method within a generally allowable limit.</e>

<j>第二は、最高裁は、上記3つの要件を充たさない写真撮影は全て違法であるとまでは述べておらず、それ以外の場合（特に、(1)現行犯的状況がない場合）でも、写真撮影を適法とする余地は残している、という解釈である。</j>

<j>その後の裁判例においては、第二の見解に立つものが続いたが、最高裁平成20年4月15日第二小法廷決定（事件番号平成19(あ)839）は、本判決について、「警察官による人の容ぼう等の撮影が、現に犯罪が行われ又は行われた後間がないと認められる場合のほかは許されないという趣旨まで判示したものではない」と述べた上で、公道上及びパチンコ店内において被告人の容ぼう等をビデオ撮影した捜査活動を適法と判断しており、少なくとも裁判例においては、第二の見解が支配的になったといえる。</j>
