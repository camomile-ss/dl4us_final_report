<e type="trans" ver="2">Kanbun-inchi was a law established through a series of documents, namely ryochi-hanmono (a shogunal letter of authorization for the possesion of and ruling over a fief), shuinjo (shogunal letters with a red seal) and ryochi-mokuroku (a document supplementing ryoci-hanmono indicating the details of a fief) which were simaltaneously issued by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) throughout the country on April 5, fourth year of the Kanbun era in the old calendar (April 30, 1664).</e>
