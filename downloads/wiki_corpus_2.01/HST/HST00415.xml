<e type="trans" ver="1">Theories about the origin of the ingubunkokusei system are as follows: it started when kanmotsu (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) and choyo (taxes in tribute and labor under the ritsuryo system) collected within Awaji Province were used to feed Imperial Prince Oi called Awaji Haitei (deposed Emperor of Awaji) who was deported to Awaji Province; it started when denso (rice field tax) and rice collected within Yamato Province were used to feed the retired Emperor Heizei who confined himself in Heijo-Kyo; and shinno ninkoku (provinces whose gubernatorial posts were reserved as sinecures for imperial princes) introduced later than the above were the beginning of the system.</e>

<e type="trans" ver="2">One theory on the origin of the ingubunkokusei system describes that it started when kanmotsu (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) and choyo (taxes in tribute and labor under the ritsuryo system) collected within Awaji Province were used to feed Imperial Prince Oi who had been deported to the province and called Awaji Haitei (deposed Emperor of Awaji). Another theory argues that the system began when denso (a rice field tax) and rice collected within Yamato Province was used to feed Retired Emperor Heizei who had confined himself in Heijo-Kyo. A third theory states that the system was established along with shinno nintoku (provinces whose governing posts were reserved as sinecures for imperial princes) system that was introduced later on.</e>
