<e type="trans" ver="1">As the Ming dynasty required Japan (bakufu, the shogunate) to crack down on Wako, the bakufu carried on trade by official ships and prohibited private foreign trade in the hope that the bakufu could exercise total control over existing profits from private foreign trade; thus, the trade by using Kangofu was implemented.</e>

<cmt>Grammar, word choice, punctuation. Having 民間貿易 and 私貿易 both as &quot;private foreign trade&quot; is confusing, but I am not sure of the difference: perhaps 民間貿易 could be translated as &quot;government controlled private foreign trade&quot;. Please check.</cmt>
