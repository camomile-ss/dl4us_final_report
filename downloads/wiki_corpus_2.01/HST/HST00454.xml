<j>だが、江戸時代に入ると、主君である征夷大将軍あるいは大名への土地支配権力の集中や藩中央と家臣の年貢米売却の競合による米価下落に伴う換金収入減少など財政上の都合から、地方知行を止めて蔵米知行に切り替える場合が増加した。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">However, in the early Edo period, more and more lords gave up Jikatachigyo (provision of lands from a feudal government or domains to retainers as salary), switching to kuramaichigyo due to the concentration of land ruling power in the hands of Seii taishogun (literally, &quot;great general who subdues the eastern barbarians&quot;) as the lord or Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord), or for financial reasons such as decrease in income caused by the drop in the rice price resulted from the competition between the domains and vassals in selling annual rice tax.</e>

<e type="trans" ver="2">During the early Edo period, however, more and more lords gave up Jigatachigyo in favor of Kuramaichigyo.

<cmt>here it is written &quot;征夷大将軍&quot; not &quot;征東大将軍&quot; so I changed the description in parenthesis to match the word list, deleting &quot;eastern&quot;; split into three sentences for easier reading; retranslated the last section to be more understandable; changed &quot;Jikatachigyo&quot; to &quot;Jigatachigyo&quot; since the wiki article gives this reading for &quot;地方知行&quot;; eliminated description of &quot;Jigatachigyo&quot; since I added the word in the sentence above and gave its description there; capitalized &quot;Taishogun&quot;; made &quot;daimyo&quot; lowercase</cmt>
