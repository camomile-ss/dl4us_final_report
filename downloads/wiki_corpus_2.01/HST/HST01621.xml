<cmt>「隠岐守」の訳が&quot;Iki no kuni no kami (Governor of Iki Province)&quot;となっていますが、間違いなので訂正しました。→ Oki no kami (Governor of Oki Province) Ise shoryo はやや英語として不自然な感じがするので、shoryo of Ise に訂正しました。     「六条院の御堂に伊勢の所領を寄進し」の解釈は、おそらく「六条院の御堂を建てるための場所を寄進した」ということだと思い、それに従って訳も訂正しました。   定訳のスペルが間違っていると思われます。次のように訂正しました。Teischi → Teishi スペルミス： Prncess → Princess に訂正しました。 「転じ」は、単に「なった」ということと解釈し、moved to をbecame に訂正しました。　スペルミス： ocassion → occasion に訂正しました。</cmt>
