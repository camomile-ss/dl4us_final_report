<e type="trans" ver="1">Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was the first government to enforce the bukeho in the form of statutory law, the Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai), which was inherited by the Kenmu Code enforced by Muromachi bakufu, the bunkokuho (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) enforced by daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku Period, and the Buke Shohatto (code for the warrior households) as well as the hanpo (code for regional domains) enforced during the time of Edo bakufu; the bukeho thus became the prototype of codes for the military government to control the nation and for the regional administrations to maintain the feudal system and the regional order within their domains.</e>
