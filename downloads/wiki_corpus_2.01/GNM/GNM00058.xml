<cmt>Neil さん、前にこの「西国三十三箇所」はここにあるように &quot;the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage&quot; と訳すと言ってましたので、ローマ字に括弧で補うかたちにしました。2回目以降は &quot;Saigoku Sanjusankasho&quot; でいいでしょうか。また、クライアントのフィードバックでは「西国三十三箇所第29番札所」を &quot;No. 29 pilgrim stamp office of the 33 Temples of Saigoku” と訳しています。どちらがよろしいでしょうか。</cmt>
