<cmt>slight modification</cmt>
<e type="check" ver="1">The Akamatsu, Isshiki, Kyogoku and Yamana clans, whose heads were feudal lords that ruled local territories as military governors, were known as the &quot;Shishiki (or Shishoku)&quot; clans (meaning &quot;four top ranking clans&quot;) and the military police director (called &quot;tonin&quot; or &quot;shoshi&quot; in Japanese) of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was chosen from among these clans in turn in order to take charge of military leadership, law enforcement and tax collection in the city of Kyoto.</e>

<e type="check" ver="1">In fact, however, the military police director was often also chosen from the Toki clan, a ruling clan in Mino Province, along with these four clans, which therefore needs to be included as a &quot;Shishiki&quot; clan.</e>
