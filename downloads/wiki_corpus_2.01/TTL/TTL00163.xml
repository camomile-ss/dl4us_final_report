<e type="trans" ver="2">Originally called &apos;fudai-no-shin (hereditary vassals),&apos; fudai daimyo were daimyo who had been vassals of the Tokugawa clan for generations (the reason these daimyo were given this name was that a fudai, which can be written as 譜第 or 譜代 in Japanese, is a written genealogy proving one&apos;s ancestry), and were involved in all aspects of managing their master&apos;s affairs, from running his household to the supervision of estates and commerce within his territory.</e>
<cmt>Talking about these daimyo having being vassals of their &quot;master&quot; seems unnecessarily vague considering the KOD defines them as follows:a daimyo in hereditary vassalage to the Tokugawas; a daimyo from one of the clans that originally supported the Tokugawa (and continued in hereditary vassalage)The meaning of &quot;譜第/譜代 is a written genealogy proving the pedigree&quot; is a bit unclear so I have had to rewrite it quite a bit.</cmt>
