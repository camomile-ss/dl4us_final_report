<e type="trans" ver="1">However, in the later days the word Jokan was often used in the sense of the last one of the expressions mentioned above, like the one in &quot;色葉字類抄 (Irohajirui-sho,&quot; Kango-Japanese Dictionary in Heian Period, in which it says that &quot;政官、上官也、云外記・史也,&quot;which means &quot;Jokan are Geki and Sho.&quot;</e>

<cmt>I understand that the translator for translation #1 didn&apos;t understand the way to read &quot;史也&quot; but I am guessing that the &quot;sho&quot; is a typo and should be &quot;shi&quot; since it would be consistent with the other readings; fixed grammar</cmt>
