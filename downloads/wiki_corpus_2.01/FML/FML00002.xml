<cmt>名字大文字originator→progenitorFujiwara-hokke&apos;s legitimate blood, the Fujiwara clan. →Fujiwara-hokke&apos;s (Fujiwara North family) mainstream of the Fujiwara clan. Even to a native speaker of English who cannot read the Japanese to check the intended meaning, it should be clear that the use of the word &quot;originator&quot; is suspect here. The sentence seems to be saying that Kanezane KUJO is the originator of the Kujo family, but given that we are not talking about the creator of something like a TV show, surely a more natural term would be &quot;progenitor&quot;.Also, I don&apos;t think a native speaker of English would understand what &quot;Fujiwara-hokke&apos;s legitimate blood&quot; is supposed to mean.</cmt>

<cmt>The edited version is OK but I have made some changes to make the meaning clearer. I also think that &quot;thus maintaining the Karoku &quot; is a mistranslation as it suggests that the reason the area of land was maintained (by the Kujo family) was because the yield increased. The Japanese doesn&apos;t, in my opinion, say this. Please check that I have understood this correctly.</cmt>
