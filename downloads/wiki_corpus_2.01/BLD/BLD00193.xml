<e type="trans" ver="1">Tenshu (main keep or tower of a castle)</e>
<cmt>本ファイル全編を通じて、(1)「天守」は、用語集に従い「Tenshu」で統一いたしました（左は初出のため、英文も記入しております）。ただし、用語集には、例えば、「弘前城天守」＝「Hirosaki-jo Castle keep」 というように「keep」（「tower」の場合もある）となっており、この場合は、これを生かし、「Tenshu」とはしておりません。</cmt>

<cmt>用語集では、「本丸」＝「Honmaru (the keep of a castle)」となっていますが、「Honmaru (the most important castle enclosure)」といたしました。 「本丸」は、[広辞苑第六版]によりますと’城の中心部にあって、天守を築いた最も主要な郭’と定義されており、用語集の「keep」は「天守」のことでこれを採用しますと、「天守」の上に「天守」を建設することになります。本文の場合の「本丸」はあくまで「天守」を建設する場所を言っており、「天守」そのものではないと考え、上記の訳にいたしました。</cmt>
