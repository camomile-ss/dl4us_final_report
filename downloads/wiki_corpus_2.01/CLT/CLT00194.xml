<cmt>This seems a little long for a heading so I have reduced the length. Please check if this works.Also, I think the ordering of adjectives is incorrect here. It should be &quot;ancient Japanese religious XXX&quot; rather than &quot;Japanese ancient religious XXX&quot;, shouldn&apos;t it?</cmt>

<cmt>This is a big improvement on the original translation (which was pretty hard to read).I do think that the definite article is required before &quot;gods&quot;, however, as we are presumably talking about the Shinto gods rather than just any old gods.
