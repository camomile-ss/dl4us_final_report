<e type="check" ver="1">&quot;The origin of Shirabyoshi is thought to have been when two women (Shima no Sensai and Waka no Mae) started to perform dances dressed as men at some point during the reign of the retired Emperor Toba.&quot;</e>
<cmt>全体的に原文の順番を変更する必要がありました。それにともなって訳文も変更しています。ご確認ください。NR: I have had to expand on this (i.e. &quot;two women started to perform dances dressed as men&quot;) as otherwise the English would sound ridiculous; that is, saying that two women happened to start dancing does not sound particularly significant, but if they happened to be dressed as men, this makes much more sense.</cmt>
