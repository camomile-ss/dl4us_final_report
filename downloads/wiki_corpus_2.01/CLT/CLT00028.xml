If the translator chooses to omit something from the translation, it would be helpful if they could point this out and explain the reasoning behind their decision.Also, although the Japanese says &quot;5116以上,&quot; I have left the &quot;以上&quot; part untranslated as it sounds odd in English to say &quot;more than&quot; with such a specific number.</cmt>
