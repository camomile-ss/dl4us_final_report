<j>芸能、技芸を技術的な問題としてのみ捉えることをせず、しばしば実生活と芸の世界を混同させて、常住坐臥が芸を高めるための契機であり、修行であると考え、しかのみならず当人の倫理性、道徳性がそのまま芸にあらわれるがゆえに、芸の向上は同時に人格の向上でなければならない、とするところに芸道の特徴がある。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">The main characteristic of Geido is the idea that performing arts and handicrafts are not just the problem of skills, but the daily lives and arts are mixed up, and at all times, there are chances to heighten one&apos;s art and ascetic practices are conducted, and not only that, since one&apos;s ethic and morality show up directly on arts, heightening of one&apos;s art should be the heightening of one&apos;s personality.</e>

<e type="check" ver="1">The main characteristic of Geido is the idea that the heightening of one&apos;s art should be simultaneously accompanied by a heightening of one&apos;s personality because one&apos;s ethics and morality are directly revealed in one&apos;s art; this is derived from the idea that rather than regarding the performance of arts and techniques as merely a matter of skill, we should merge our everyday lives and the world of art, which is an opportunity to heighten our art and is itself a form of training.</e>
