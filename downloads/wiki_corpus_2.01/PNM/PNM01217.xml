<e type="trans" ver="2">Based on what was mentioned in the previously mentioned Eiga Monogatari (Tale of Glory), he may have had his coming-of-age ceremony and may have received a Joshaku (peerage) (i.e. if he was born in 910, and had his coming-of-ceremony at 15 or 16, he must have received peerage in 924 or 925), but seeing that he could not get any positions within the Court, he may have decided to enter priesthood right away.</e>
