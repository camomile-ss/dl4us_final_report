<j>この説に基づくと弓月君が秦の（初代の）皇帝から五世の孫とする記述に反せず、「秦」つながりで渡来した人々が勝手に｢秦｣を名乗り始めたと考えてもさほど矛盾はないが、根拠は少なく今後検証の必要がある。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">According to this theory, it matches with the description that states Yuzuki no kimi is the descendent of the first Qin Emperor in the fifth generation and there is not much contradiction to consider that the people who came to Japan and related with &quot;Qin&quot; started to call themselves &quot;Hata&quot; on their own, however the evidence is few and it needs to be verified in future.</e>

<e type="trans" ver="2">Although this theory does not contradict the description stating that Yuzuki no kimi was a grandson of the fifth generation from the first Qin Emperor and there is not much contradiction in assuming that people in connection with &quot;Qin&quot; came to Japan and started to call themselves by the surname &quot;Hata&quot; (the kanji character representing &quot;Qin&quot; is pronounced &quot;Hata&quot; in Japanese) on their own, the theory does not have sufficient basis and verification will be required.</e>
