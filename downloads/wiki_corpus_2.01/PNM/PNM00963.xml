<j>1399年、応永の乱のときに兄に従って堺市に籠城したが、兄が将軍・足利義満率いる幕府軍の火攻めにあって戦死したため、その軍門に降った。</j>
<e type="trans" ver="1">In Oei Rebellion in 1399, he held up in a castle in Sakai City following his elder brother, however, as the elder brother was killed in a fire attack launched by the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) commanded by Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, he surrendered to Yoshimitsu.</e>

<e type="trans" ver="2">During the Oei Rebellion in 1399, he joined his elder brother in holding a castle in Sakai City against the army of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) led by Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA; when his elder brother was killed in a fire attack launched by the besieging army, however, Hiroshige surrendered to Yoshimitsu.</e>
<cmt>The translation is fairly chokuyaku and a bit difficult to follow. Only looking at the English I would have no idea what &quot;he held up in a castle in Sakai City following his elder brother&quot; meant. Please make sure you translate the meaning rather than just the words.I do think &quot;fire attack&quot; seems a little unnatural, but without knowing the details of how this was carried out, I can&apos;t be sure of what a more appropriate term might be.</cmt>
