<cmt>Wording. As the translator has commented, the first sentence in parenthesis should be part of the previous sentence, thus would read &quot;(distributed from September 1933 to May 1935).&quot;. Also, is &quot;using this version as an original&quot; referring to Othello or all of the revised editions of all the aformentioned books? If it is all editions, I think it should read &quot;using these versions as originals&quot;.</cmt>
