<e type="trans" ver="1">Some sees Naosuke as a consistent exclusionist that the reason for Naosuke to preach for the opening of Japan and to sign the treaty were a temporal measure against involvement of powerful lords from Mito and Satsuma, to shogunate government, and he was aiming for bakufu and supporting Shinpan (Tokugawa&apos;s relatives) and fudai daimyo to take lead in expulsion of foreigners, after Edo bakufu restored the real power of politics.</e>
