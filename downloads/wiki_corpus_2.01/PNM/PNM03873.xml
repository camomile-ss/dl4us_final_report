<e type="trans" ver="1">However, Tamemori&apos;s name appears in the historical materials published after 1183. In &quot;Gukansho&quot; (Jottings of a Fool) the author writes that Tamemor served as an envoy for his father Yorimori at the time of leaving the capital; therefore, his death during the Battle in the Kurikara Pass might be a writing error.</e>
